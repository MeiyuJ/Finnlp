I have a brief statement, and then I\u2019ll be happy to respond to your questions. The job market remains strong, the economy continues to expand, and inflation appears to be moving toward the FOMC\u2019s 2 percent longer-run goal.  As you already know, we decided today to raise the target rate  for the federal funds rate by \u00bc percentage point, bringing it to 1\u00bd to 1\u00be percent.1  This decision marks another step in the ongoing process of gradually scaling back monetary policy accommodation\u2014a process that has been under way for several years now. Job gains averaged 240,000 per month over the past three months, well above the pace needed in the longer run to absorb new entrants into the labor force.  The unemployment rate remained low in February at 4.1 percent, while the labor force participation rate moved higher.  Over the past four years, the participation rate has remained roughly unchanged.  That\u2019s a sign of improvement, given that the aging of our population is putting downward pressure on the participation rate, and we expect that the job market will remain strong. Although the growth rates of household spending and business investment appear to have moderat ed early this year, gains in the fourth quarter were strong and the fundamentals underpinning demand remain solid.  Indeed, the economic outlook has strengthened in recent months.  Several factors are supporting the outlook:  F iscal policy has become more stimulative, ongoing job gains are boosting incomes and confidence, foreign growth is on a firm trajectory, and overall financial conditions remain accommodative.\n\nMarch 21,\n\nAgainst this backdrop, inflation remains below our 2 percent longer -run objective. Overall consumer prices, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, increased 1.7  percent in the 12 months ending in January.  The core price index, which excludes the prices of energy and food and is typically a better indicator of futur e inflation, rose 1.5 percent over the same period.  However, as we have noted for some time, the shortfall of inflation from 2 percent reflects, at least partly, some unusual price declines that occurred nearly a year ago.  In coming months, as those earl ier declines drop out of the calculation, inflation should move up closer to 2 percent and stabilize around that level over the medium term.  Of course, various forces will continue to affect inflation.  A t times it may be above 2 percent, just as at times  it may be below.  Our inflation objective is symmetric in the sense that we are trying to prevent persistent deviations from 2 percent in either direction. Based on the projections that Committee participants submitted for this meeting, the median project ion for the growth of inflation- adjusted GDP is 2.7 percent this year, 2.4 percent next year, and 2 percent in 2020, a bit above its estimated longer -run rate.  The median projection for unemployment \u2014for the unemployment rate stands at 3.8 percent in the f ourth quarter of this year and runs at 3.6 percent over the next two years, almost a percentage point below the median estimate of its longer -run normal rate.  Finally, the median inflation projection is 1.9 percent this year, 2 percent next year, and 2.1 percent in 2020.  Compared with the projections made in December, real GDP growth is stronger, the unemployment rate is lower, and inflation is slightly higher. As I noted earlier, today\u2019s decision to raise the federal funds rate is another step in the process of gradually scaling back monetary policy accommodation as the economic expansion\n\nMarch 21,\n\ncontinues.  This gradual process has been under way for more than two years , and it has served \u2014and should continue to serve \u2014the economy well. In making our policy decisions over the next few years, we will continue to aim for inflation of 2 percent while sustaining the economic expansion and a strong labor market.  In the Committee\u2019s view, further gradual increases in the federal funds rate will best promote these goals.  By contrast, raising rates too slowly  would raise the risk that monetary policy would need to tighten abruptly down the road, which could jeopardize the economic expansion.  At the same time, we want to avoid inflation running persistently below our  objective, which could leave us with less scope to counter an economic downturn in the future. Participants\u2019 projections of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate reflect our gradual approach.  The median projection for the federal funds rate is 2.1 percent at the end of this year, 2.9 percent at the end of 2019, and 3.4 percent at the end of 2020.  By 2020, the median federal funds rate is modestly above its estimated longer -run trend.  Most participants revised up their projections since Decembe r, although the median projection for this year did not change.  The medians for 2019 and 2020 are somewhat higher than in December. Of course, we\u2019ll be watching how the economy evolves in the months and years ahead relative to our maximum employment and p rice stability objectives.  If the outlook changes, we will adjust monetary policy appropriately. Finally, I\u2019ll note that our program for reducing our balance sheet, which began in October, is proceeding smoothly.  Barring a very significant and unexpected weakening in the outlook, we do not intend to alter this program.  As we\u2019ve said, changing the target range for the federal funds rate is our primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy.  As always, the Committee would be prepared to use its full range of tools if future economic conditions\n\nMarch 21,\n\nwere to warrant a more accommodative monetary policy than can be achieved solely by reducing the federal funds rate. Thank you, and I\u2019ll be happy to take your questions now. STEVE LIESMAN.   Mr. Chairman \u2014rig ht, the microphone.  Mr. Chairman, welcome. Interesting changes in the forecast.   A higher growth forecast a full point above the long run, lower unemployment seven -tenths  below the long run, a nd yet very little change in inflation. What does that say ab out what you and the Committee believe about the inflation dynamic ?  And how is it that, in that context, you justify three rate hikes this year \u2014and I sense there\u2019ll be three next year \u2014and a full $600 billion, I guess, annual rate decline in the balance sheet?  Where's your biggest concern here?  Is it in overkill when it comes to rates or underkill? CHAIRMAN POWELL.  So, you\u2019re right that the outlook did improve, as I mentioned and as you\u2014as was in your question.  The Committee \u2019s estimates of growth went u p, the Committee \u2019s estimates of unemployment went down, and there was a very slight increase in inflation.  And I think that reflects, essentially \u2014if you think back to the era after the crisis, unemployment was 10 percent.  It\u2019s now 4.1 percent.  You \u2019ve only seen very gradual upward pressures on inflation and wages despite that very large increase.  And that suggests that the relationship between changes in slack and inflation is not so tight.  But, it has diminished, but it \u2019s still there.  So I think when you see those small changes in unemployment, that simply reflects the, you know, the flatness of the Phillips curve, if you will. STEVE LIESMAN.  And your biggest concern or your biggest risk here \u2014is it doing too much, doing too little? CHAIRMAN POWEL L.  You know, I think we \u2019re trying to, we \u2019re trying to be, to take the middle ground there.  So, you know, on the one hand, the risk would be that we wait too\n\nMarch 21,\n\nlong, and then we have to raise rates quickly , and that foreshortens the expansion.  We don\u2019 t want to do that.  The \u2014on the other side, if we \u2014if we raise rates too quickly, inflation, then, really doesn \u2019t get sustainably up to 2 percent , and, that will hurt us going forward.  We need that, and it \u2019s, you know, we need to make sure that inflation expecta tions are anchored at 2  percent . So we \u2019re trying to take that middle ground, and the Committee continues to believe that the middle ground consists of further gradual increases in the federal funds rate as long as the economy is broadly on this path. NICK TIMIRAOS.  Thanks.  I\u2019m Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.  Chair Powell, I want to ask about the symmetric inflation target\u2014what you outlined in your remarks as preventing persistent deviations.  I want to understand what symmetry means in the  context of inflation b eing allowed to run above the 2 percent  target now that that \u2019s part of the projection for\u2014at least for core PCE next year.  How do you define symmetric relative to the experience of the past five years?  Would the Fed be willing to a ccept the type of overshoot of its target as it has seen during the undershoot?  And how high above 2 percent is too high to maintain a target that is symmetric?   Is it 2\u00bc, 2\u00bd, 2\u00be ?  And also, for how long? CHAIRMAN POWELL.   You know, so as you noted, the \u2014what we \u2019ve said in the longer -run statement of goals and monetary policy strategy is that we would be concerned with sustained or persistent deviations of inflation either above or below.  We \u2019ve also said \u2014in minutes and in speeches and things like that \u2014that  that is a symmetric objective.  So, that \u2019s how we think of it.  And, I think it \u2019s\u2014I wouldn\u2019 t characterize what we \u2019ve done over the last five years as tolerating, you know, an undershoot of inflation.  We were always pushing toward 2 percent , and I think that is how we look at it.  I can \u2019t give you an exact number.  It just, you know, it, we haven \u2019t agreed on that.  It just is that we \u2019re always going to be seeking 2 percent\n\nMarch 21,\n\ninflation.  And in doing that, we \u2019re going to be considering, by the way , the other side of the mandate.   You know, we have to balance that against the deviation of employment from \u2014 unemployment from its goal.  And \u2014and also , just the duration of it as well. JIM PUZZANGHERA.  Hi, Mr. Chairman.  Jim Puzzanghera with the L.A. Time s.  Even with the extra fiscal stimulus of the tax cuts, your median growth projection is just up to 2.7 percent, and then\u2014this year \u2014and then drops back down to 2 percent by 2020.  Is the continued talk in Washington about tax cuts bring ing growth to 3 per cent or higher on a sustained basis overselling their potential impact? CHAIRMAN POWELL.  You know, let me say what that really is.  So the Summary of Economic Projections  is really a compilation of the individual rate forecasts.  The C ommittee made really  one decision at this meeting, and that was to raise the federal funds rate by 25 basis points.  The Summary of Economic Projections is individual forecasts compiled and written down.  And, you \u2019ve identified the median as 2.7 percent .  I would\u2014and that \u2019s an interesting statistic .  I would also say that the central tendency is interesting.  The full range is interesting. So you have a range of views around the table.  One of the great benefits of our system is that we do have R eserve Banks with their own s taffs and Governors with different views , and so we discuss these things.  So the C ommittee doesn \u2019t vote or agree upon the medians, so you \u2019re going to have a range of views.  That \u2019s really all I can say \u20142.7 just happens to be the median for \u2019 18, but it doe sn\u2019t really say, you know, what we think is possible. JIM PUZZANGHERA.  But do you think you can get to 3 percent on a sustained basis? CHAIRMAN POWELL.  You know, I would say it \u2019s hard to say, but it would take \u2014you know, that is well above almost all estimates, current estimates of potential long -run growth.  It\n\nMarch 21,\n\nwould take, you know, significant increases in productivity and labor force participation to get there. JEANNA SMIALEK.  Hi, Jeanna Smialek with Bloomberg New s.  So obviously you guys reduced your NAIRU  estimate s slightly  today, but if you continue to see job gains around 200,000 a month, primary labor participation rising slightly, pretty sustainably, you know, moderate wage increases, at what point are you guys going to start to question whether y ou\u2019re actually overshooting full employment?  And, if you start to question that, how is that going to impact policy? CHAIRMAN POWELL.  So I guess I \u2019d start by saying that the natural rate of unemployment is not something that we can observe directly.  We look at a wide range of indicators on that \u2014you know, 15 or 20 of them at least .  And also, I think we all understand that any point estimate is surrounded by very wide uncertainty bands .  So as the \u2014as the actual unemployment rate has declined  from 10 perce nt to 4.1 percent , the Committee \u2019s median estimate of the natural rate of unemployment has also declined by a full percentage point.  So the Committee \u2014and , I think, people \u2014are generally influenced by data.  As they see unemployment going lower, they \u2019re loo king at a variety of aspects of the labor market, including wage inflation and price inflation.  So I don\u2019 t think we, we \u2014we \u2019re mindful of the uncertainty of that, and we \u2019ll be looking at that.  So, as \u2014if inflation \u2014if unemployment does continue to go down, we \u2019ll continue to do that.  As I mentioned earlier, there is no \u2014there\u2019 s no sense in the data that we \u2019re on the cusp of an acceleration of inflation.  We have seen moderate increases in wages and price inflation, and we seem to be seeing more of that.  We\u2019ll be alert to that.  I guess the idea \u2014the theory would be that if you get below the sustainable rate of unemployment for a sustained\n\nMarch 21,\n\nperiod, you would see an acceleration of inflation.  So we would know that then, a nd we \u2019re very alert to it, but it\u2019 s not something we observe at the present. SAM FLEMING.  Thanks very much.  Sam Fleming from Financial Times.  You and other policymakers have talked about headwinds turning into tailwinds recently.  Does that imply that you think now a higher neutral rate of interest is operative in the U.S. economy, and how would you assess the implications for monetary policy?  And s econd question\u2014this is obviously your first press conference, so it \u2019s a little early to ask this question, but would you like to do this more ofte n?  Thanks. CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Longer -run values like the neutral rate of interest, the natural rate of unemployment, the potential growth rate of the economy are pinned down by slow - moving forces over time.  So they don\u2019 t\u2014they don\u2019t  move around very much.  So I wouldn\u2019 t expect the Committee \u2019s, you know, predictions or projections or estimates of those values to move quickly.  They \u2019ll move slowly.  So is it possible that the neutral rate of interest would move up because of, for example, greater fiscal expan sion?  There\u2019 s literature that says that. There\u2019s \u2014there are reasons that that might be the case.  In fact, it did tick  up one -tenth , as you all know, in the \u2014in the median at this time.  But it\u2019 s\u2014I think, generally speaking, the Committee sees the neutral rate of interest as still quite low and is not\u2014is not seeing it as having moved up and is open to the possibility that it will. SAM FLEMING.   And p ress conferences ? CHAIRMAN POWELL.   Ah, press conferences.  So that \u2019s something that I \u2019m go ing to be carefully considering.  I have not made a decision about it.  My colleagues and I are committed to communicating as clearly as possible about what we \u2019re doing and why we \u2019re doing it.  I would want to think very carefully about it and make sure that no one would take more\n\nMarch 21,\n\nfrequent press conferences as a signal of the path of policy.  And so, it is  something that I \u2019ll be thinking about. ADAM SHAPIRO.  Adam Shapiro with the Fox Business Network .  You brought up the fiscal stimulus and the impact it\u2019 s having, and I was curious , how is the change in the federal budget deficit \u2014because the stimulus is coming with great debt \u2014has it changed your approach to how many securities you \u2019re going to allow to roll off the balance sheet, and is there a level of Treasury supply at which the Fed would consider adjusting its balance sheet roll -off, given how much the U.S. government \u2019s going to have to borrow going forward?   And, then a second question, things beyond your control \u2014the President  is expected to announce  new tariffs against China, and does  the Committee discuss what potential impacts that could have in regards to inflation ?  And do you have a timeline as to how you would respond to that? CHAIRMAN POWELL.  So, in terms of the balance sheet, we \u2019ve said that , you know, we carefully developed this plan .  We carefully socialized it in a series of meetings last year.  We announced it, and we said we wouldn\u2019 t change it , really , unless there were a significant downturn that required, you know, meaningful reductions in interest rates.  And I have no inclination to revisit that.  We \u2019re going to use monetary policy as the principle tool of adjusting, you know, our policy. So, on the second question, on tariffs, a number of participants in this FOMC did bring up the is sue of tariffs, and if I could summarize what came out of that , it was, first, that there \u2019s no thought, I think, that changes in trade policy should have any effect on the current outlook. Second thing is, I would say , is that a number of participants rep orted in \u2014about their conversations with business leaders around the country and reported that trade policy has become a concern going forward for that group.\n\nMarch 21,\n\nMART IN CRUTSINGER.  Marty Crutsinger with the Associated Press.  You talked about the fact that th e Summary of Economic Projections is based on the outlook of all the members of the FOMC.  Can you tell us anything, though, about the staff forecast and how that was impacted by the\u2014we had a $1\u00bd trillion tax cut, w e\u2019ve had $300 billion  in increased government spending \u2014the staff forecast that you \u2019re working with, are those reflected \u2014how were they impacted by that?   And how did that impact the discussions? CHAIRIMAN POWELL.  So w e look at the staff forecasts and the Board forecasts \u2014and , by the way, the re are 12 excellent Reserve Bank staffs who have their own views and do their own work\u2014w e look at those as informing the decisions of the policymakers.  So \u2014and it \u2019s really the policymakers \u2019 views that we talk about in the SEP .  We don\u2019 t\u2014we do n\u2019t, you know, talk about the staff forecast.  It\u2019s a particular thing under \u2014done under particular rules and circumstances .  And, really, it \u2019s the policymakers that then take that as input and create their forecasts , which are what drive policy. MART IN CRUTSINGER.  That had no impact, though?   It\u2019s s uch a\u2014that \u2019s a major increase in government stimulus that you \u2019re\u2014that had to have  had an impact on the discussions, I would think, though. CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Well , the\u2014you\u2019re right.  So fiscal stimulus is a, y ou know, a meaningful input into, you know, into the SEP and particularly in the changes over the course of last year and this year.  And individual policymakers went through, with their staffs, a range of estimates, a range of literature, and did their ow n thinking and came up with their own estimates and submitted those as their Summary of Economic Projections \u2014as their projections.  Those are not the staff \u2019s projections.  Those are our projections.\n\nMarch 21,\n\nHEATHER LONG.  Heather Long, Washington Post .  I\u2014what wil l it take to get to four rate hikes this year?  It \u2019s clear from the dot plot that many members do think four would be appropriate, but clearly something was holding a number of the FOMC members back.  Is it concerns about these potential trade tariffs that  are going into effect?  Is it just that people want to wait and see a little longer before they raise?  Can you give us some more insight into why people didn\u2019 t go to four this time \u2014the media n\u2014even though the economic projections look very healthy? CHAIRMAN POWELL.  I would go back to the thought that, you know, we made one decision at this meeting , and that decision was to raise the federal funds rate by 25  basis points. The projections are really just individual projections t hat ar e submitted and then compiled.  And, you know, you \u2019re mentioning the median as being, you know, three and four being close , but, you know, I think, like any set of forecasts, those forecasts will change over time, and they \u2019ll change depending on the way the outlook for th e economy changes.  So that \u2019s really all I can say.  It could change up.  It could change down.  I wouldn\u2019 t want to \u2014for now, these are the best forecasts that people could make , and, you know, it could be that if the economy \u2019s a little bit stronger or a li ttle bit weaker, then the path could be a little less gradual or a little more gradual. HEATHER LONG.  So it wasn \u2019t one factor that was pulling at the heart of the discussion ? CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Not, no . JIM TANKERSLEY.  Mr. Chairman, a quick follow on the trade question, and then a productivity question.  On trade, what would have to happen in policy \u2014and, in particular , in potential retaliation from countries around the world\u2014for trade policy to become a concern for the Committee \u2019s outlook?  And then, the second question is , you mentioned productivity growth\n\nMarch 21,\n\nearlier.  What \u2019s your current assessment of the path of productivity growth, and has anything in policy \u2014any policy change in recent months changed that assessment? CHAIRMAN POWELL.  You know, for trade, what I mentioned is that our FOMC participants reported in that they had heard, you know, concerns , which were relatively new , about \u2014about  future trade actions, really.  And they \u2019re seeing it as a risk -to-the-outlook kind of thing.  So \u2014and the kind of thi ngs people are talking about would be, you know, more widespread retaliation and more widespread actions  back -and-forth kind of thing.  I can \u2019t be any more specific than that. In terms of productivity \u2014productivity, as I \u2019m sure you know, has been very weak  since the financial crisis.  It\u2019s averaged only about 0.5 percent a year for the last six years , I guess.  So that\u2019s well below, you know, longer -run averages, and it would certainly be a good thing to see it move up.  It has moved up just a little bit but not , kind of , decisively. And, you know, you asked me about fiscal policy and the connection to productivity.  I think in the tax bill there\u2019s \u2014there are incentives for \u2014there\u2014 a tax cut bill that allows expensing of investments should encourage additional i nvestment that should encourage productivity.  In theory, an individual tax bill that lowers tax rates should encourage more labor force participation.  So I do think it \u2019s very important that we have a focus on productivity in the country.  It\u2019s not something that we can really do at the Fed , but, you know, we \u2019re certainly hopeful that there will be supply -side effects like that from the tax bill.  I think estimates are really all over the place in terms of the amount and the timing of those. JONATHAN SPICE R.  Chairman Powell, Jonathan Spicer with Reuters.  I take your caveats on the dot plot , as it were, but I \u2019ll ask another question.  In 2020, it shows that policymakers expect the policy rate to get up almost to 3\u00bd percent , which is quite a ways \u2014or,\n\nMarch 21,\n\ndefini tively , anyways \u2014above the neutral rate.  Does that increase the risk of a Fed -induced recession and decrease the risk of a soft landing?  Which is asking , in a way , about the fiscal policy .  And, as a follow -up, is that fiscal stimulus starting to lead to questions within the F ed around this narrative of secular stagnation and the economy entering a new sort of \u201c low rates \u201d environment?  Thanks. CHAIRMAN POWELL.  You know, I would say that \u2014remember that forecasts  three years out \u2014so, you\u2019 re righ t, in 2020 there \u2019s a\u2014I think it\u2019s 3.4 percent  is the median of the SEP dots for 2020, which is 40 basis points above the estimates of the neutral rate, which I would characterize as, you know, modestly restrictive, modestly  tightening policy, but that\u2019 s three years in the future.  It\u2019s highly uncertain.  You know, we don\u2019 t have the ability to see that far into the future, so I really wouldn \u2019t put a lot in that.  It could make sense.  You could imagine narratives in which that  would make sense, but I honestly I wouldn\u2019 t put too much on that.  Sorry, your second question was? JONATHAN SPICER.   The second question was whether the secular stagnation narrative\u2014 whether fiscal policy is being questioned by the Fed around that ? CHAIRMAN POWELL.  You know, we \u2019ve been throug h many years of growth around 2 percent , and I \u2019ve given a number of public remarks where I \u2019ve called on, you know, the country to focus more on potential growth and productivity and labor force participation, wh ich drive potential growth.  So, you know, I think it \u2019s really important that we do something \u2014do what we can as a country to increase our  potential growth rate.   I would say in the bill that passed Congress, the Tax Cuts and Jobs A ct, there were elements t hat should encourag e productivity, as I mentioned\u2014sorry, encourage investment, which should help productivity, encourage labor force participation.  We don\u2019 t know how big those effects are going to be.  We don\u2019 t know what\n\nMarch 21,\n\nthe timing would be.  I think , as you look around the table at the FOMC, there \u2019s a wide range of views on the amount and the timing of those.  I think all of us would agree that we hope that they will be large. MICHAEL DERBY.  Hi.  Mike Derby from Dow Jones Newswires .  I have a question about the future of the mechanics of monetary policy.  I wanted to know whether you favor sticking with the system that you have now of keeping interest on ex cess reserves and reverse repo\u2014the reverse repo rate to control interest rates \u2014or do you want to s hift back to the old way of doing things at  some point of targeting the fed funds market?  And do you have any concern that if you do sti ck with the current system that , as rates rise, that you might see issues where the Fed is under \u2014is being criticized fo r paying out ever larger shares of money to banks  to, you know, to control interest rates that some might perceive as a subsidy to the banks that are getting this money? CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Sure.  Our current framework for implementing monetary policy is wor king very well.  We have excellent contro l over rates, and it \u2019s working.  And it\u2019s\u2014 you described it accurately.   We haven \u2019t made a deci sion to keep that as our longer -run framework.  We haven \u2019t really addressed that question.  We \u2019ve had meetings where we\u2019 ve talked about it, and we \u2019ve agre ed that it\u2019 s working well.  But it\u2019 s\u2014and it \u2019s not something I see us as needing to urgently address.  I think we \u2019re continuing to learn about this framework.  For example, one \u2014in the long -run, the size of the balance sheet  is going to depend on the public \u2019s demand for our liabilities , including currency and reserves.   So we don\u2019 t know what the demand is for reserves in a world where you have \u2014you know, you have regulations that require banks to hold lot s of high- quality liquid assets, and reserves are one of those.  So it \u2019s not something we \u2019re looking at resolving in the near  term.\n\nMarch 21,\n\nYou mentioned the question of interest on excess reserves, and I think it \u2019s a little bit of a misnomer to think that there \u2019s a subsidy there.  We pay interest on excess reserves.  We can \u2019t pay interest on excess reserves that are \u2014is above the general level of short -term interest rates. So we \u2019re paying rates that banks can get from other interest rates from other \u2014any other investment in the short -term money markets.  In addition, r emember that those liabilities \u2014those are our liabilities.  The assets that we have on the other side are T reasury securities and mortgage -backed securities , which yield much higher than interest on reserves.  So, in fact, i t\u2019s not a subsidy, and it \u2019s not a cost to the taxpayer. GREG ROBB.  Over here.  Thank you, Chairman.  Thank you very much.  Greg Robb from MarketWatch.  Several of your colleagues recently have been speaking and expressing concern about financial imbalances and rising signs of financial imbalances.   I was wondering if you could give us your view on the asset markets.  Are\u2014do you see any bubbles?   And do you have the tools you need, you think, to combat those?   Thank you very much. CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Since the financial crisis, we\u2019 ve been monitoring financial conditions and financial stability issues very carefully, and the FOMC receives regular briefings about the staff framework and , sort of , measures of various aspects of financial \u2014financial stability risks, and the current view of the Committee is that financial stability vulnerabilities are moderate, let \u2019s say .  And I\u2019ll go through a couple of pieces of that. So, if you look at the banking system, particularly the large financial institutions, you see higher capital.  You see much higher liquidity.  You see them more aware of their risks and better able to m anage them with stress testing.  And if one \u2014if something does go wrong, you\u2019 ve got\u2014you\u2019ve got  better ability to deal with the failure of those institutions.  So, therefore, you don\u2019t see high leverage.  You don\u2019 t see excess risk -taking in great quantity the way you did s ee\n\nMarch 21,\n\nbefore the crisis.  If you look at households, household balance sheets are in much better condition.  If you look at nonf inancial corporations, you see \u2014you do see relatively elevated levels of borrowing, but nothing that suggests, you know, serious risks.  And, of course, default rates are very low.   So those readings look okay.  I should mention also that for large financia l institutions, they \u2019re no longer funded by a lot of short -term wholesale funding, which can disappear very quickly , so they \u2019re far less vulnerable to liquidity issues.  Overall, those aspects, I think, suggest low levels of vulnerability. You identified t he\u2014really, one area where\u2014which is an area of focus , which is asset prices.  So, in some areas, asset prices are elevated relative to their longer -run historical norms. You can think of some equity prices.  You can think of commercial real estate prices i n certain markets.  But  we don\u2019 t see it in housing, which is key.  And so, overall, if you put all of that into a pie, what you have is moderate vulnerabilities , in our view.  In terms of whether we have the tools, you know, we have some tools, and I think we ce rtainly \u2014we use them.   We have\u2014 I think the stress test is a really important tool that we have for the largest financial institutions and for the smaller financial institutions.  We regularly use that to \u2014as a way to test against various, you know, mar ket shocks, c ertainly for the larger institutions. VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi.  Victoria Guida with Politico.  More on the regulatory side, you know, the F ed might soon be getting more power to de cide exactly which regulations \u2014which stricter regulations to apply to banks with between $100 and $250 billion in assets.  And so I had a couple of questions about that.  So, for CCAR, those stress tests, since that \u2019s based around, you know, having a punitive penalty of potentially being able to restrict divi dend payouts or stock buybacks, i s there any kind of logistical challenge that could be posed if you don\u2019 t have CCAR every year for certain banks?  Is it possible to have CCAR not on an annual basis?\n\nMarch 21,\n\nAnd then, m y other question is, you know, you\u2019ve talked a lot about how size isn \u2019t the only thing that causes banks to pose systemic risk, and I was wondering , what other factors do you think would cause a bank to potentially pose a systemic risk? CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Okay.  So, this is a matter that Congress has under consideration.  It\u2019s not something \u2014so Congress is looking at raising the threshold for applying enhanced financial standards to\u2014f rom $50 billion to $250 billion, while leaving us with the ability to reach below $250 billion and apply those standards where we think it \u2019s appropriate. And, you know, we haven\u2019 t been shy about doing that , because, of course, one of the eight SIFIs is below 250 already.  So we are fully prepared to do that.  But this is a decision t hat\u2019s in the hands of Congress .  It\u2019s not something th at\u2019s been \u2014been  taken.  The version of the bill, I think, that passed the Senate did have \u2014did give us the ability to do supervisory stress tests periodically , as opposed to annually , is the language.  We haven \u2019t made any decision about that at all.  We woul d want to think very carefully about that, and, you know, we would\u2014whatever we do decide to do, we \u2019d put that out  for comment.  Is it, you know, logistically possible?  I would think it would be, but it \u2019s certainly not something that we \u2019ve decided to do.  And the second question you had was? VICTORIA GUIDA.   About w hat causes banks to pose systemic risk beyond size . CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Sure.  Well, it\u2019 s\u2014I guess the next thing on the list would be activities.  So, you know, we \u2014regular  way c ommercial banks that  do deposit  taking and lending and don\u2019 t specu late in markets, y ou know, that \u2019s one business model.  Another business model might be, you know, if you think of a hedge fund, right?   That \u2019s what they do.  They \u2019re speculating on markets, and\u2014 you know, so ver y different business models and different levels of risk and that sort of thing.  So, that \u2019s\u2014that would be the next thing on the list.  I mean, there\n\nMarch 21,\n\nwould be a range of things, you know \u2014how well capitalized is the institution, but mainly those things. MICHAEL MCKEE.  Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio.  I\u2019d like to go back to the idea of the additional growth that you\u2019 re getting from the fiscal package and ask you how much you think comes from the supply side and how much from demand?   You use words like  \u201cmight \u201d and \u201c should\u201d  about what results should come from this process , but, around the table, did any of the presidents or G overnors report that businesses are actually getting ready to spend?   Is this something that\u2019 s going to happen?   Do we know that there \u2019s going to be a supply -side effect, or are you just guessing at this point? CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Remember that there ar e 15 FOMC participants, and we \u2014each of us has his or her own forecast.  So there \u2019s a real diversity of views on this, pa rticularly on these fiscal issues.  If I could try to summarize, it woul d be that , I think, broadly speaking , participants believe there will be meaningful increases in demand from the new fiscal policies for at least the next, let \u2019s say, three years.  I think there \u2019s a general view as well that supply -side issues\u2014that there could  be supply -side effects as well, and  you would see that again through higher investment, driven by lower corporate tax rates and the expensing of some investment , which would drive \u2014tend to drive productivity over time.  If you make investment more attractive, companies should do more  of it.  It\u2019s uncertain, though.  I mean, I spent many years of my life working with companies and discussing\u2014and , you know, the cost of capital is one  of many factors that they \u2019ll consider.  It isn \u2019t the only factor or the principle factor, but it should result in more investment, and investment should drive productivity. At the same time, the \u2014you know, I mentioned labor supply.  You should see some labor supply effects over time from lower individual effective tax rates.  The whole thing is very\n\nMarch 21,\n\nuncertain, and particularly the supply -side effects should and would be expected to take longer to appear and would be less certain in amount.  So that \u2019s really  as good as you can go.  And, you know, we \u2019ve all looked at the literature carefully.  We\u2019ve all thought about it.  We \u2019ve discussed it with our in -house experts and come up with our own views, a nd they \u2019re disparate, but that \u2019s\u2014 I\u2019d say that \u2019s about where the \u2014where the views are. DONNA BORAK.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Donna Borak with CNN.  Just to go back to trade policy, if you don\u2019 t mind.  You said that participants today generally are feeling that the trade policy shouldn\u2019 t necessarily affect the current economic outlook, but I am wondering if there was any discussio n\u2014if there are fears about inflationary effects , should t here be trade barriers imposed?  And, secondly, you know, we  might be on the verge of a tit- for-tat trade war with China.  Wondering wha t your thoughts are of how that might dampen the economic \u2014the global economic outlook going forward should that occur . CHAIRMAN POWELL.  You know, at this stage, what our FOMC participants discussed \u2014it wasn \u2019t\u2014it was \u2014it was just that this is a new risk that had been probably a low - profile risk , which has become, you know, a more prominent risk to the outlook.  That \u2019s really what people were saying.  They didn \u2019t get into talking about particular \u2014you know, whether it \u2019s inflation or growth or whatever it would be.   So that \u2019s not something that did come up.  You know \u2014your second question, sorry, was China? DONNA BORAK.  Ye s.  I mean, in the event t hat the United States and China \u2014in the event that the  U.S. and China end up in a tit -for-tat trade war, or any other retaliatory actions that are imposed elsewhere against the United States, what that means for the global economic outlook, and whether that was something that was discussed a nd are you worried about .\n\nMarch 21,\n\nCHAIMRAN POWELL.   That didn\u2019 t\u2014it\u2019 s not something that ca me up in particular. And, let me say, you know, we don\u2019 t do trade policy here at the F ed, and, you know, I would be reluctant to comment on any particular situation with any particular country. NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  Nancy Marshall -Genzer with Marketplace.  Does the interest rate hike today suggest that Americans are being paid enough?  Are you satisfied with the rate of wage growth right now? CHAIRMAN POWELL.  As I mentioned, you know, we \u2019ve had unemployment decli ne sharply since, I guess, 2010, when it peaked at 10 percent and down to 4.1 percent now, and we\u2019ve seen only modest increases in wages.  So, on the one hand, what wages should in theory represent is inflation plus productivity increases.  You should get paid for yo ur productivity plus inflation .  And productivity \u2019s been very low.  Inflation \u2019s been low.  So these low wage increases \u2014in a sen se, they do make sense in that \u2014from that perspective. On the other hand, as the market ha s tightened, as labor markets have tightened, and we hear reports of labor shortages and  we see that, you know, groups of unemployed are diminishing, and the unemployment rate is going down, w e haven \u2019t seen, you know, higher wages \u2014wages going up more.  And  I would\u2014 I think I \u2019ve been surprised by that, and I think others have as well.  In terms of what \u2019s the right level, I don \u2019t think I have a view on what the right level of wages is, but I think we will \u2014we will know that the labor market is getting tight when we do see a more meaningful upward move in wages. VIRGINIE MONTET.  Virginie  Montet with Agenc e France -Presse.   If the economy behaves as the F ed is predicting, by the time of the midterm elections, the rates will be \u2014keep on rising, a nd the prime r ate wi ll be above \u2014well above 5 percent , a level not reached in 10 years for what is a base of consumer credit.  And we know that , historically, raising rates \u2014especially\n\nMarch 21,\n\nin campaign times \u2014has never been very popular in the White House.  Does this prospect of a possible pressure and dichotomy of concerns keep you awake at night? CHAIRMAN POWELL.  No.  That doesn\u2019 t keep me awake at night.  We don\u2019 t consider the election cycle.  You know, we \u2014we \u2019re looking very carefully at our assigned responsibilities of maximum employment, stable prices, and that \u2019s really our focus.  You can count on us to stay focused on the jobs that Congress has assigned us and count on us to use the tools we have to achieve them.  You \u2019re right, that \u2019s the highest rate.  By the way, I \u2019m hearin g this, the 10- year thing a few times these day s, and it \u2019s true that rates are higher than they \u2019ve been in 10 years.  On the other hand, the economy \u2019s healthier than it\u2019 s been since\u2014since  before the financial crisis. So, it \u2019s a healthier economy than it \u2019s been in 10 years.  The financial crisis, of course, was just really getting going 10 years ago. MYLES UDLAND.  Thanks.  My les Udland, Yahoo Finance.  Ch air Powell, I \u2019m curious if the F ed would be willing to tolerate an inverted yield curve.  We continue t o see the spread between the 2 -year and the 10- year tighten , even with longer -term yields coming up since the beginning of the year.  This is a dynamic that has typically preceded recessions, and we\u2019 re likely to see sh orter -term rates come up as the F ed continues to increase rates.  So, I \u2019m just curious if you guys have discussed that, if you\u2019 d be willing to push back against that , or if that\u2019 s a dynamic you\u2019d be comfortable with? CHAIRMAN POWELL.  You know, it \u2019s an interesting question, and ther e are a range of views there.  I think it \u2019s true that yield curves have tended to predict recessions if you look back over many cycles, but a lot of that was just situations in which inflation was  allowed to get out of control, and the F ed had to tighten, and that put the economy into a recession.  That \u2019s really not the situation we \u2019re in now, so I don \u2019t know that that \u2019s\u2014I don\u2019 t know that \u2014I don \u2019t think that\n\nMarch 21,\n\nrecession probabilities are particularly high at the moment, any higher than they normally are. But, havin g said that, I think it\u2019 s\u2014there are good questions about what a flat yield curve or inverted yield curve does to intermediation.  It\u2019s hard to find in the research data, but nonetheless, I think those are issues that we \u2019ll be watching carefully. Thank you very much."

I know that a number of you will want to talk about the details of our announcement today, and I am happy to do that in a few minutes.  But because monetary policy affects everyone, I want to start with a plain -English summary of how the economy is doing, what my colleagues and I at the Federal Rese rve are trying to do, and why. The main takeaway is that the economy is doing very well.  Most people who want to find jobs are finding them, and unemployment and inflation are low.  Interest rates have been low for some years while the economy has been recovering from the financial crisis.  For the past few years, we have been gradually raising interest rates, and along the way we\u2019ve tried to explain the reasoning behind our decisions.  In particular, we think that gradually returning interest rates to a more normal level as the economy strengthens is the best way the Fed can help s ustain an environment in which American households and businesses can thrive.  Today, we\u2019ve taken another step in that process by raising our target range for the federal funds rate by \u00bc of a percentage point. My colleagues and I meet eight times a year and take a fresh look each time at what is happening in the economy and consider whether our policy needs adjusting.  We don\u2019t put our interest rate decisions on hold or on autopilot, because the economy can always evolve in unexpected ways.  History has shown that moving interest rates either too quickly or too slowly can lead to bad economic outcomes.  We think the outcomes are likely to be better overall if we are as clear as possible about what we are likely to do and why.  To that end, we try to give a sense of our expectations for how the economy will evolve and how our policy stance may change.\n\nJune 13,\n\nAs Chairman, I hope to foster a public conversation about what the Fed is doing to support a strong and resilient economy.  And one practical step in doing so is to have a press conference like this after every one of our scheduled FOMC meetings.  And we\u2019re going to do that beginning in January.  That will give us more opportunities to explain our actions and to answer your questions.  I want to point out that having twice as many press conferences does not signal anything about the timing or pace of future interest rate changes.  This change is only about improving communications.  My FOMC colleagues and I will also continue to issue our economic projections on the existing quarterly schedule. Now, let me go into more detail over developments in the economy, our economic projections, and our policy decision.  Economic growth appears to have picked up in the current quarter, largely reflecting a bounceback in household spending.  Business investment continues to grow strongly, and the overall outlook for growth remains favorable.  Several factors support this assessment:  Fiscal policy is boosting the economy, ongoing job gains are raising incomes and confidence, foreign economies continue to expand, and overall financial conditions remain accommodative.  These observations are consistent with the projections that Committee participants submitted for this meeting.  The median projection for the growth of real GDP is 2.8 percent this year, 2.4 percent next year, and 2  percent in 2020.  Compared with the projections made in March, this median growth path is little changed. In the labor market, job gains averaged 180,000 per month over the past three months, well above th e pace needed in the longer run to provide jobs for new entrants into the workforce. The unemployment rate declined over the past two months and stood at 3.8 percent in May, its lowest level in nearly two decades.  Meanwhile, the labor force participation  rate has been roughly unchanged since late 2013.  That is a positive sign, given that the aging of our\n\nJune 13,\n\npopulation is putting downward pressure on the participation rate.  And we expect the job market to remain strong.  As you can see in our Summary of Economic Projections, the median of Committee participants\u2019 projections for the unemployment rate stands at 3.6  percent in the fourth quarter of this year and runs at 3.5 percent over the next two years, a percentage point below the median estimate of its lon ger-run normal rate.  This median path is just a bit lower than that from March. After many years of running below our 2  percent longer-run objective, inflation has recently moved close to that level.  Indeed, overall consumer prices, as measured by the pr ice index for personal consumption expenditures, increased 2 percent over the 12 months ending in April.  The core PCE index, which excludes prices of energy and food and tends to be a better indicator of future inflation, rose 1.8 percent over the same period.  As we had expected, inflation moved up as the unusually low readings from last March dropped out of the calculation.  The recent inflation data have been encouraging, but after many years of inflation below our objective, we do not want to declare victory.  We want to ensure that inflation remains near our symmetric 2  percent longer-run goal on a sustained basis.  As we note in our Statement of Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, the Committee would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below our 2 percent objective.  Of course, many factors affect inflation \u2014some temporary and others more lasting\u2014and at any given time inflation may be above or below 2 percent.  For example, the recent rise in oil prices will likely pu sh inflation somewhat above 2 percent in coming months.  But that transitory development should have little, if any, consequence for inflation over the next few years.  The median of participants\u2019 projections for inflation runs at 2.1 percent through 2020.  Relative to the March projections, the median inflation projection is a little higher this year and next.\n\nJune 13,\n\nAs I mentioned, today we took another step in gradually scaling back monetary policy accommodation by raising the target range for the federal funds  rate by \u00bc  percentage point, bringing it to 1\u00be  to 2 percent.  We also made some changes to our policy statement, reflecting that policy normalization is proceeding broadly as we have expected.  None of these changes signals a change in our policy views.  F or example, we removed the language stating that \u201cthe federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.\u201d  Since we introduced that language a few years ago, the economy has strengthened, and the Committee has raised the federal funds rate from near 0  to 1\u00be to 2 percent. As we continue to note in our statement, we expect to make further gradual increases in that rate.  As a result, if the economy evolves broadly as we anticipate, the federal funds rate will, over the next year or so, move well within the range of estimates of the normal long -run level.  Therefore, we thought that now is an appropriate time to remove this forward guidance from our policy statement. We continue to believe that a gradual approach for increasing the federal funds rate will best promote a sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near our symmetric 2  percent goal.  We are aware that raising rates too slowly might raise t he risk that monetary policy would need to tighten abruptly down the road in response to an unexpectedly sharp increase in inflation or financial excesses, jeopardizing the economic expansion.  Conversely, if we raise interest rates too rapidly, the econom y could weaken , and inflation could continue to run persistently below our objective. The Committee\u2019s gradual approach is reflected in participants\u2019 projections for the appropriate path for the federal funds rate.  The median projection for the federal funds rate is 2.4 percent at the end of this year, 3.1 percent at the end of 2019, and 3.4 percent at the end of\n\nJune 13,\n\n2020.  By 2020, the median federal funds rate is modestly above its estimated longer-run level. These projections are very similar to those made in March.  Although the median federal funds rate edged up this year and next, most participants did not revise their projections. I\u2019ll conclude by mentioning two additional matters.  First, our program for reducing our balance sheet, which began in Octobe r, is proceeding smoothly.  Barring a material and unexpected weakening in the outlook, this program will proceed on schedule, and our balance sheet will continue to shrink.  As we have said, changing the target range for the federal funds rate is our prim ary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy. And, finally, as discussed in the minutes of our May meeting, we\u2019re making a small technical adjustment in one of our tools for implementing monetary policy.  To keep the federal funds rate in the targe t range, we rely on the rate of interest on excess reserves, or the IOER rate. Up until now, we have set the IOER rate at the top of the target range for the federal funds rate.  In recent months, the federal funds rate has moved up toward the IOER rate as short- term interest rates have risen more generally.  So to move the federal funds rate closer to the middle of the target range, we are now setting the IOER rate 5  basis points below the upper end of the target range.  This minor technical adjustment has no bearing on the appropriate path for the federal funds rate or financial conditions more generally.  Thanks for listening, and I\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. JIM TANKERSLEY.  Hi, Mr. Chairman.  Jim Tankersley, New York Times .  I have a question about inflation and a question about growth.  On inflation, I\u2019m curious if there\u2019 s anything that\u2019s happened since March that has changed your assessment of the risk of inflation increases beyond what you forecast in the year to come.  And , on growth, you m entioned fiscal\n\nJune 13,\n\npolicy is adding to growth, and I\u2019m curious if you could break that down a li ttle bit further for us and say\u2014what effects do you think the recent tax cuts are having on growth? CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Sure.  So since\u2014I wouldn\u2019 t say anything has h appened since March to really change the way I \u2019m thinking about inflation or the way the Committee \u2019s thinking about inflation.  We\u2019ve seen inflation move very gradually up toward our 2 percent objective. And part of that has been just idiosyncratic things dropping out from last March, which were holding inflation\u2014measured inflation \u2014down.  Part of it is just that continued tightening in the labor market and the economy more broadly is pushing inflation up.  So we continue to think, and the Committee continu es to think, that we are just about at our 2 percent goal but, as I mentioned, not ready to declare victory until we sustain that over time, which we haven\u2019t done yet. You also asked about fiscal policy, and there\u2019 s a range of views on the Committee and , I think more broadly, a range of views among economists generally.  But I can say that the Committee members \u2014Committee participants \u2014generally believe that the fiscal changes \u2014and that includes both the tax cuts, individual and corporate, and the spending changes\u2014will provide meaningful support to demand, significant support to demand over the course of the next three years.  And the question\u2014the other question is, what about the supply side?  So it is\u2014 it makes sense that if you lower corporate tax rates an d allow faster expensing of investment, you will encourage greater investment.  That should drive productivity.  That should increase potential output.  So that really ought to happen as well.  I think the amounts and the timing of that coming in are also quite uncertain.  There\u2019s also the possibility that there would be more labor supply from lower individual tax rates, again, in amounts and in timing that might be more uncertain.  So that\u2019s how the Committee generally is thinking about\u2014about fiscal policy.\n\nJune 13,\n\nNICK TIMIRAOS.  Thanks.  Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal .  So the Fed is about four interest rate increases , using the projections released today, away from what might be considered a neutral fed funds rate.  And I wanted to ask how you\u2019re thinking about what to do once you get to neutral.  Under what conditions would you decide, once you get there, that it\u2019 s okay to stop raising rates?  And under what conditions would you want to keep going? CHAIRMAN POWELL .  So for many, many years, we\u2019 ve been far from maximum employment and stable prices, and so the need for accommodative policy has been \u2014has been clear.  As the economy has strengthened and as we\u2019 ve gradually raised interest rates, the question comes into view of, how much longer will you need to be accommodative?  And how will you know?  How will you know where\u2014at what point policy will be neutral?  Neutral meaning that interest rates are neither pushing the economy up nor trying to restrain it.  So we know that we\u2019 re getting closer to that neutra l level.  We don\u2019 t have an exact sense of how that will be.  So the Committee is discussing, very actively, the questions that you raise.  And, really, it boils down to a question of, what is appropriate policy?  And, you know, I\u2014you asked, how will we kno w?  So I think we\u2019ll be very carefully looking at incoming data on inflation, on financial readings, and on the labor market.  We have to acknowledge that there are always wide uncertainty bands around the level of, for example, the natural rate of unemployment.  But also, what is the neutral rate of interest ?  What is that rate of interest that pushes neither up nor down?  So I think we\u2014 we\u2019ll be guided by incoming data on the economy and try to keep our minds open as we move forward. HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Howard Schneider with Reuters.  2.1 percent above target for two and a half years  starts to feel like some of the alternate frameworks that have been discussed\n\nJune 13,\n\nhere, be it price- level targeting or trying to set expectations higher so that you hit your 2.  In deciding how symmetric is too symmetric, what sort of parameters are you using on that front? CHAIRMAN POWELL.  You know, the\u2014our target for \u2014our medium- term objective for inflation is 2  percent PCE inflation.  We feel that that target has served the econom y well, and I \u2019m strongly committed to it.  The Committee is strongly committed to it.  The sort of barriers to making a material change to that would be \u2014would be very high because, again, we think it\u2019s fundamental, and we think it\u2019s worked. You asked about price-level targeting and that sort of thing.  You know, there are some ideas that sort of take cognizance of the fact that rates are lower , we\u2019 re near the zero lower bound, and that could put downward pressure on inflation expectations if we\u2019 re going to be down at the  zero  lower bound and, therefore, sort of undermine the credibility of the 2 percent inflation objective.  So the idea is to have kind of a makeup.  If you\u2014if you \u2019re below target for a while, you have a\u2014you have a time of being above target.  And the idea is to enhance the credibility of that 2  percent \u2014that 2  percent target.  This is an idea that \u2019s been written about for many years. It\u2019s not something that the Committee has looked at seriously.  I imagine we will be having discussions about it, but\u2014not something that we have on the calendar right now. SAM FLEMING.  Well, thanks very much.  Sam Fleming from the Financial Times . Over the weekend, we saw some significant tensions within the G-7.  In Canada, there is the potential, obviously, for further action against China right now and  retaliatory action from major U.S. trading partners.  How big a risk do you currently see this as being to the United States economy?  And what kind of feedback are you getting in terms of corporate investment intentions?  Is there something that\u2019s beginning to feature more prominently in your own discussions with major U.S. companies?  Thanks.\n\nJune 13,\n\nCHAIRMAN POWELL.  I ought to star t by saying that, you know, Congress has assigned us very important jobs and\u2014you know, maximum employment, stable prices , we have a role in financial stability that we share with other agencies.  Congress has very specifically given authority over trade to the executive branch, so I wouldn\u2019 t comment on any particular specific trade actions.  I will say that we, of course, have\u2014we have broad contacts in \u2014among business leaders around the country.  And the Reserve Bank presidents, in particular, have that.  And so they report in the Beige Book and then in person at the FOMC meeting.  And they do come back and they say that concerns about changes in trade policy are arising, I think it\u2019 s fair to say, and also that you\u2019re beginning to hear reports of companies holding off on making investments and hiring people.  So right now we don\u2019 t see that in the numbers at all.  The economy is very strong.  The labor market is strong.  Growth is strong.  We really don\u2019 t see it in the numbers.  It\u2019s just not there.  But\u2014so I w ould put it down as more of a risk. STEVE LIESMAN.  Steve Liesman, CNBC.  Mr. Chairman, you said there\u2019 s a difference of opinion among economists, but looking at the longer-run GDP growth rates for the members of the Committee, there \u2019s not a whole lot of difference.  It \u2019s 1.8 to 2, or 1.7 to 2.1, depending upon how you count it.  Is that showing us that not a single member of the Committee\u2014including yourself, Mr. Chairman\u2014agrees with economists over at the White House that they can achieve long -run sustained growth rates above or at 3 percent or higher?  Do you believe in that? CHAIRMAN POWELL.  You know, first of all, that\u2019 s a\u2014that \u2019s a reasonable range, I think, of\u2014it\u2019s not that we\u2019 re all on the same number, but there are a range of views about potential gr owth.  And there\u2019s so much uncertainty around this.  You know, we don\u2019t\u2014the thing about fiscal policy is, you don\u2019t have thousands of incidents to, you know, to\u2014you don\u2019 t have\n\nJune 13,\n\nbig data, in a way.  You have very small data.  You\u2019ve got only a few instances here, so you have a lot of uncertainty around what the effects will be.  They could be large.  We hope they\u2019 re large. But I think our approach is going to be to watch and see and hope that, in fact, we do get significant effects to, you know, to potential growth out of the tax bill, and we\u2019 re just going to have to see. STEVE LIESMAN .  How would you forecast it though? CHAIRMAN POWELL.  I think we \u2019re looking at a reasonable range of estimates and we\u2019re putting every \u2014different participants are putting differ ent estimates in and we\u2019 re going to be waiting and seeing. DONNA BORAK.  Donna Borak with CNN.  You said earlier that it\u2019 s still a little too early to declare victory on inflation.  I wanted to circle back on a question that was asked at the initial press conference about what\u2014what  does the Fed say  in regards to the inflation target as symmetric ?  Like has the Committee given any further thought in terms of how comfortable it would be rising above\u2014whether it goes higher than 2.1, if it reaches 2.2, 2.3, and for how long?  And now that you\u2019re planning to hold these regular press conferences, starting next year, how do you explain \u2014how do you plan to explain that to the American people that inflation is not overrunning? CHAIRMAN POWELL.  You know, what we \u2019ve said in our Statement of Longer-Run Principles  and Monetary Policy Strategy is that the Committee would be concerned if inflation were to run persistently above or below 2 percent, persistently above or below 2 percent.  And that\u2019s what we mean by symmetric.  We \u2019re looking at it equally on either side and it\u2019 s a matter of persistent overruns.  We know that inflation is going to bounce around.  For example, as I mentioned, later this summer there \u2019s a good chance that headline inflation will move up above\n\nJune 13,\n\n2 percent because of oil prices.  Things buffet inflation back and forth, but\u2014so we acknowledge that, we understand that\u2014and if inflation were to persistently run above or below 2 percent, then we would be using our tools to try to move inflation back in the direction of the target.  We do understand, though, that we don\u2019 t have the ability to precisely hit that target, so we expect that inflation will be above or below.  And we just hope that that is\u2014happens on a symmetric basis. MARTIN CRUTSINGER.  Marty C rutsinger, Associated Press.  At this meeting, you hiked your \u2014the funds rate, you changed the dot plot to move from 3 to 4 for this year, and you took out a sentence that you\u2019d been using for years about how long rates might stay low.  But you say that none of this signals a change in policy views.  But shouldn\u2019 t we see from this combination of things that the Fed is moving to tighter policy? CHAIRMAN POWELL.  I think what you should see is that the economy is continuing to make progress.  The economy has strengthened so much since I joined the Fed, you know, in 2012 and even over the last couple of years.  The economy is in a very different place.  We\u2014 unemployment was 10 percent at the height of the crisis.  It\u2019s 3.8 percent now and moving lower.  So reall y what you \u2014the decision you see today is another sign that the U.S. economy is in great shape.  Growth is strong, labor markets are strong, inflation is close to target, and that\u2019 s what you\u2019re seeing.  For many years, as I mentioned \u2014many years \u2014we had inter est rates held low to support economic activity.  And it\u2019 s been clear that as we\u2019ve gotten closer to our statutory goals, we should normalize policy, and that\u2019 s really what we\u2019ve been consistently doing for some years now. HEATHER LONG.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Heather Long from the Washington Post .  Can you give us an update on what the FOMC thinks about wages?  Are we finally going to see that\n\nJune 13,\n\nwage growth pickup this year?  I know you\u2019 re forecasting a little bit more inflation, but is that going to translate through to wage growth? CHAIRMAN POWELL.  You know, wages have been gradually moving up.  Earlier in the recovery, they were \u2014there are many different wage measures, of course, but \u2014so just\u2014but just to generalize, wages were running roughly around 2 percent and they\u2019ve moved gradually up into between 2 to 3 percent as the labor market has become stronger and stronger.  I think it\u2019 s fair to say that some of us\u2014 and I certain ly would have expected wages to react more to the very significant reduction in unemploym ent that we \u2019ve had, as I mentioned, from 10 percent to 3.8 percent.  Part of that can be explained by low productivity, which is something we\u2019 ve talked about at the Committee and elsewhere.  But, nonetheless, I think we had anticipated, and many people have anticipated, that wages \u2014that in a world where we\u2019re hearing lots and lots about labor shortages\u2014everywhere we go now, we hear about labor shortages\u2014 but where is the wage reaction?  So it \u2019s a bit of a puzzle.  I wouldn\u2019 t say it\u2019s a mystery, but it\u2019 s a bit  of a puzzle. And, frankly, I do think there\u2019s a lot to like about low unemployment.  And one of the things is \u2014you will see \u2014pretty much people who want to get jobs\u2014not everybody\u2014but people who want to get jobs, many of them will be able to get jobs.  You will see wages go up.  You\u2019 ll see people at the, sort of, the margins of the labor force having an opportunity to get back in work.  They benefit from that.  Society benefits from that.  So there are a lot of things to really like, including higher wages, as you asked.  Our role, though, is also to, you know, to make sure that\u2014that maximum employment happens in a context of price stability and financial stability, which is why we \u2019re gradually raising rates. DON LEE.  Just a follow-up on\u2014Don Lee from the L.A. Times .  On both inflation and unemployment, the new projections\u2014for unemployment lower than before and inflation higher.\n\nJune 13,\n\nAnd how much is the Fed willing to accept that\u2019s an overshoot for both of those before it affects policy? CHAIRMAN POWELL.  You ment ioned that unemployment moved down and  inflation moved up by truly small amounts.  If you look at the Summary of Economic Projections, things are moving by just a tick or even a semitick  between now and March.  And you asked, you know\u2014I mean, I think we ta ke a longer -run view that we\u2019re shooting for\u2014 we\u2019re aiming for \u2014 2 percent inflation \u2014inflation around 2 percent.  We know that it\u2019ll be above or below.  We\u2019 re not going to\u2014we didn\u2019t overreact, I think, to inflation being under 2 percent.  We won \u2019t overreact t o it being over 2 percent.  And I think we\u2019ll always be using our tools to move inflation in the direction of the target, if it\u2014if it leaves \u2014if it moves away from the target persistently, as I mentioned. In terms of unemployment, you know, you have to acknowledge that we are\u2014no one really knows with certainty what the level of the natural rate of unemployment is, the rate that is sustainable over a long period of time.  And we know that probably that rate has declined as the U.S. population has become more educated, as it has become older.  Older and more educated people have lower unemployment rates.  We don\u2019t know this with precision.  So we have to be learning as we go.  We\u2019ve got to be looking at data and informed by what\u2019s coming in.  And as I mentioned, I think at the last press conference, estimates by the\u2014by members of the Committee have moved down by a full percentage point since maybe 2012 as we\u2019 ve learned \u2014as unemployment has dropped and inflation hasn\u2019 t really reacted.  So I can \u2019t give you a precis e number, but I just\u2014you know, we will be very much informed by incoming data.  And this uncertainty is why \u2014the fact that we live in that uncertainty is why we \u2019ve been gradually raising rates.  We\u2019re not waiting for inflation to show up.  We\u2019re go ing ahead  and moving gradually and\n\nJune 13,\n\ntrying to navigate between two risks, really.  One would be moving too quickly\u2014inflation never gets back to target  if we do that.  And the other is moving too slowly, and then we have\u2014we have too much inflation or financial instability, and we have to raise quickly.  And that can also have bad outcomes. CHRISTOPHER CONDON.  Chris Condon, Bloomberg News.  Mr. Chairman, I have a couple questions about the interest the Fed pays on excess reserves.  And you mentioned, of course, that \u2014that the IOER was raised by the Committee 20  basis points, and that\u2019 s a result , as you said , of the upward drift of the effect ive fed funds rate in that target range.  Do you think that that\u2019s going to resolve that issue or might there be further action required by the Committee in the future to continue lowering IOER relative to the midpoint of the range?  And, further, was there discussion among the Committee today about what\u2019 s causing that?  Is it purely technical, perhaps related to bill issuance, or is it telling you something about the level of scarcity and truly excess bank reserves?  Thank you. CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Thanks.  So I would say that\u2014remember the important thing is that we want the federal funds rate to trade in the target range.  That \u2019s the whole, the whole idea. IOER is the principal tool by which we assure that that will happen.  And we\u2019ve said in our, you know, basic documents that we will adjust the use of our tools, as appropriate.  We don\u2019 t expect to have to do this often or again, but we\u2019re not sure about that.  If we have to do it again, we\u2019ll do it again.  Again, don\u2019t expect it to happen.  You asked why.  And yes, you know, we\u2014of course, we\u2019re looking carefully at that and, you know, the truth is we don\u2019t\u2014we don \u2019t know with any precision.  Really, no one does.  It\u2019s\u2014 you can \u2019t run experiments, you know, with one effect and not the other.  You know, I think there\u2019s a lot of probability on the idea of just high bill supply leads to higher repo costs, higher money market rates generally, and the arbitrage pulls up\n\nJune 13,\n\nfederal funds rate toward s IOER.  We don\u2019t know that that\u2019s the only effect and, you know, we\u2019re just going to have to be watching and learning.  And, frankly, we don\u2019t have to know today.  What we really need is to have the federal funds rate trade in the range, and that\u2019 s what this minor technical adjustment accomplishes. EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Edward Lawrence from Fox Business.  So with the numbers that we \u2019re looking at, you talked about more people getting jobs, the wages are increasing.  Are we seeing a\u2014 with the fiscal policy \u2014a fundamental shift in the economy, where we have lower natural unemployment, also possibly a lower rate of natural unemployment and lower inflation? CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Your question\u2014your first question, really, is, do we think the natural rate of unemployment is lower?  So I think we do believe it has moved down significantly over a long period of time.  We don\u2019t think that the natural rate of unemployment\u2014you know, it\u2019s not one of those variables that moves around a lot.  It tends to be driven by slow-moving variables, like the education level, the population, like the functioning of the labor market, and things like that.  So, you know, it may\u2014it may have moved down too, on a cyclical basis , lower.  As th e economy gets hotter and hotter, there\u2019s some possibility of that.  But, you know, the thing is, if you look back, there have been a lot of studies done and, you know, real-time estimates of the natural rate of unemployment have uncertainty bands, which a re\u2014which are quite wide, so we have to remember that and very much be guided by the\u2014by the incoming data. You asked about inflation.  You know, inflation we look about\u2014we look at the 2 percent inflation objective as something that central banks, the Fed , really  control.  And we have to be strongly committed to achieving that using our tools to do that.  I think in\u2014in recent years the dominant force has been, you know, disinflationary\u2014have been pushing down on inflation.  And\n\nJune 13,\n\nso we \u2019ve been pushing back up.  Of course, all those years when we were growing up, it was the opposite.  Inflation was too high and central banks were constantly pushing down.  It\u2019 s really important that inflation not fall below 2  percent , that inflation expectations remain well anchore d at 2 percent \u2014very important\u2014because the implications of inflation below 2  percent are that you\u2019re closer to the zero lower bound, meaning the Fed has less room to cut, meaning that we\u2019 ll spend more time there and we won \u2019t be able to do the job that we\u2019 re assigned to do for our citizens. JEANNA SMIALEK.  Jeanna Smialek with Bloomberg Television.  You guys moved the median unemployment forecast for 2020 down to 3.5 percent but left the longer- run at 4.5 percent today.  But you\u2019 re only forecasting a moderate overshoot on the fed funds rate beyond your longer-run value.  How are you going to get unemployment from 3.5 percent up to that 4.5 percent rate? CHAIRMAN POWELL.  I would just \u2014would\u2014I would just emphasize, emphasize that\u2014a couple things.  First, we\u2019 re learning about the real location of the natural rate of unemployment as we go.  So it\u2019s moved down by more than a full percentage point since 2012.  So it\u2019s not so simple as thinking, oh boy, we \u2019ve just got to go ahead and get that rate up.  If you\u2014if you look at the forecast, two years from now, end of 2020, you\u2019 re still seeing inflation very close to target.  So there\u2019s no sense that inflation will\u2014no sense in our models, or in our projections, or forecasts\u2014that inflation will take off or move unexpectedly  quickly from these levels, even if unemployment does remain low.  So that\u2019s\u2014that \u2019s what \u2014so it\u2019 s important to know that the\u2014the unemployment rate forecasts go with the inflation forecasts and go with the rate forecasts.  And so each person who\u2019 s submitting  them is submitting accommodate \u2014you know, appropriate monetary policy that fits with that person\u2019s assessment.  And their\n\nJune 13,\n\nassessments generally are to support maximum employment and stable prices around 2 percent. So if we thought that inflation were going to take off, obviously, we\u2019d be showing higher rates, but that\u2019s not what we think will happen. JEANNA SMIALEK.  If I could just follow up really quickly.  Then why, I guess, would the longer- run unemployment rate not be a little bit lower and closer to that 2020 number? CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Yeah, it may be.  It may be.  We may find that out.  You know, the best estimate that we have, over the longer run, is that.  Although, you know, there\u2019 s a range of views, you know.  Some people are in the low 4s, and, again, I said the uncertainty bands are, you know, not quite a full percentage point on either side, but \u00be of a percent, that kind of thing, so it\u2019s very possible.  We have to be, you know\u2014 we can \u2019t do\u2014we can \u2019t be too attached to these unobservable variables.  You know, we\u2014I think we have to be practical about the way we think about these things and we do that by being grounded in the data and what we see happening in the real economy. VICTORIA GUIDA.  I have a couple of regulatory questions.  First of all, on the countercyclical capital buffer, I was wondering, what are the chances that the Fed is going to need to use that in the next year or two?  And then my second question is, there\u2019 s been a lot of talk lately in Congress about the ability for banks to serve marijuana businesses, and I was wondering if you think that banks should be able to serve those businesses in states where marijuana is legal. CHAIRMAN POWELL.  So the countercyclical capital buffer gives us the ability to raise capital requirements on the largest institutions when financial stability vulnerabilities are meaningfully above normal.  That\u2019s the language that we\u2019ve used.  And that\u2019 s certainly a possibility.  I wouldn\u2019 t say that\u2014I wouldn't look at today\u2019 s financial stability landscape and sa y\n\nJune 13,\n\nthat risks are meaningfully above normal.  I would say that they\u2019re roughly at normal.  You have\u2014you know, households are well\u2014you know, are in good shape.  They\u2019 re\u2014they\u2019 ve paid down their debt, incomes are rising, people have jobs.  So households are not really a concern.  And banks are highly capitalized, so that\u2019 s not really a concern.  We see\u2014there\u2019s some concern with asset prices in a couple of pockets.  But overall, if you\u2014if you bake it all  in, I think we see, generally, financial vulnerabilities as moderate.  Could that change, you asked, over a couple of years?  Yeah, it could. You also asked about marijuana businesses.  So this is a very difficult area because we have state law \u2014many state laws permit the use of marijuana and federal law still doesn \u2019t.  So it puts, you know, federally chartered banks in a very difficult situation.  I think it would be great if that could be clarified.  We don\u2019t have\u2014you know, it puts the supervisor in a very, very difficult position.  And, of course, this isn\u2019t our\u2014our mandate has nothing to do with marijuana, so we don\u2019t really \u2014we just would love to see it clarified, I think. JOHN HELTMAN.  Hi, John Heltman with American Banker .  So since you\u2014since even before you were Chairman of the Fed, when you were chair of the supervisory committee , you laid out a sort of regulatory revision agenda that \u2019s actually been pretty consistent .  So there was the guidance on boards of governors, there was the\u2014some changes to the stress tests, and \u2014not changes to the stress test, but rather clarification on the modeling \u2014and now, more recently, the changes to the enhanced supplemental leverage ratio.  The Fed has also proposed some changes to the Volcker rule and, as I mentioned a minute ago, changes to the stress test with the stress capital buffer.  Are these kind of the\u2014are there any new frontiers of regulatory changes that you are envisioning or are you just\u2014are you kind of done for the time being?  Or what el se can we expect from the Fed?\n\nJune 13,\n\nCHAIRMAN POWELL.  It \u2019s actually a pretty full docket right now.  You mentioned a number of the things , but I would\u2014I would point out\u2014we \u2019re having, I guess, a public Board meeting tomorrow on the single counterparty credit limit provision.  We\u2019ve also got quite a lot of work to promulgate rules to\u2014after S. 2155 that  Senator Crapo\u2019 s bill passed \u2014we\u2019 ve got  a lot of work to do under that.  We\u2019ve got to think about how we would reach below that $250 billion threshold to assess and supervise, regulate, you know, financial stability risks below that level. So what am I missing?  There\u2019s \u2014there \u2014oh, oh, net stable funding ratio is out there to be done.  So there\u2019s a lot of work to do, I think.  You know, and if I can just take this opportunity to say, you know, the financial system all but failed 10 years ago.  We went to work for 10 years to strengthen it\u2014stronger capital, stronger liquidity, stress testing, resolution planning.  We want to keep all that stuff.  We want to make it, you know, even more effective and certainly more efficient.  We want to tailor those regulations for institutions.  We want the strongest provisions to apply to the most systemically important institutions.  And so we \u2019re committed to preserving and enhancing that structure.  But we\u2014we \u2019re finding a lot that we can do in the way of tailoring regulations for the smaller, less systemically important institutions, and that\u2019s a lot of what we\u2019 re working on right now. GREG ROBB.  Thank you.  You said at the beginning of your press conference that you plan to be more plainspoken.  And so, okay, I wanted to know what you would say to workers who are worried that, you know, these paths of rate hikes that you\u2019ve laid out will kind of undercut the wage growth they are just starting to see.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN POWELL.  You know, I would say that the economy is in great shape.  If you look at household surveys, confidence is high.  Look at businesses, confidence is high.  If you ask \u2014if you survey workers about the job market, they\u2019 ll say that it\u2019s a really good\n\nJune 13,\n\nenvironment to find jobs.  If you survey businesses, they\u2019 ll say that workers are scarce.  So I think overall, we have\u2014we have a really solid economy on our hands here.  And so what we\u2019 re doing is, we are trying to conduct monetary policy in a way that will sustain that expansion, keep the labor markets strong, and keep inflation above\u2014right at\u2014sorry, not above, but right at 2 percent.  That \u2019s really what we\u2019re trying to do and, you know, I would say I like the results so far.  We \u2019re\u2014we \u2019ve been very, very careful not to tighten too quickly.  I think we\u2019 ve been patient.  I think that patience has borne fruit and I think it continues to.  We had a lot of encouragement to go much faster and I\u2019 m really glad we didn \u2019t.  But, at this time, the \u2014 continuing on that gradual pace seems\u2014continues to seem like the right thing.  If we get a sense that the economy is reacting badly, then we\u2019 ll certainly react to that. DAVID HARRISON.  Hi, David Harrison with Dow Jones Newswires.  Where do you see the neutral interest rate is right now?  Do you think it\u2019s\u2014do you see it sort of inching up because of the recent fiscal stimulus measures?  And how will you know when we\u2019 re getting close to that neutral point?  So if\u2014you know, if inflation stays around 2, it doesn\u2019t go above 2 for a while, do you see a need to actually exceed that neutral point? CHAIRMAN POWELL.  So I would just point you to the range of estimates at the Committee, which I think is 2\u00bc  to 3\u00bd, and the median is 2.9, right in there.  So that\u2019 s the range of estimates of the nominal neutral rate of interest.  And we do understand that there\u2019s high uncertainty around the level, but that\u2019s kind of\u2014so you can think of 2.9 as being\u2014which is sort of a full percentage point away from where fed funds is going to trade after today\u2019s decision.  You asked, is the\u2014is the neutral rate moving up because of fiscal policy?  Yes.  I mean , there\u2019s\u2014there should be an effect if you have increased deficits that should put upward pressure on, you know, a few tenths, let\u2019s say.  Again, though, they were estimating these things.  It\u2019 s one\n\nJune 13,\n\nof these unobserved variables so it\u2019s very hard to\u2014we shouldn\u2019 t try to speak about it with a \u2014 with a lot of precision or confidence.  But, yes, that should put upward pressur e on it.  How will we know?  Well, I think you have to look at inflation.  You\u2019ve got to look at\u2014 you\u2019ve got to look at all of the indicators in the economy and look at inflation, look at unemployment, look at what \u2019s happening in the job market.  And inflat ion is really important.  It \u2019s worth noting that the last two business cycles didn\u2019 t end with high inflation \u2014they ended with financial instability \u2014so that\u2019s something we need to also keep our eye on. VIRGINIE MONTET.  Virginie Montet with Agence France -Presse.  Have you talked during the meeting about when the Fed is going to remove or change the word \u201caccommodative\u201d that describe the monetary policy for almost 10  years?  And could this change in the vocabulary make the market nervous?  And have you thought already at some options so to know how you\u2019re going to call it down the road? CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Yes, that is \u2014that is something that we discuss.  We look at all the language.  As you know, we made a\u2014we made a significant number of changes at this meeting.  So language gets in the statement and then, you know, the economy changes.  That\u2019 s what happens.  We really \u2014our approach to policy hasn\u2019t changed.  And, you know, as I mentioned earlier, for a long time, the economy has  needed accommodative monetary policy.  As the economy has recovered, we\u2019 ve been gradually raising rates and we will \u2014we will be at a place relatively soon when, again, assuming we stay on this path, when interest rates will be in the zone of what FOMC participants think is roughly neutral.  And, at that point, it would no longer be accurate for us to say that the Committee thinks that policy is accommodative.  We know that\u2019s coming.  We kind of don\u2019 t think it\u2019s here yet, but it\u2019s certainly coming.  And I think that the market will understand that.  I mean , the real message is that you \u2019re getting close to the\n\nJune 13,\n\nneutral rate.  It \u2019s a characterization about where policy is.  It \u2019s not a statement , really , that should upset the markets.  But, you know, we\u2019ll obviously discuss it carefully in meetings and communicate about it.  So. NAOATSU AOYAMA.  Thank you very much.  Naoatsu Aoyama from the Asahi Shimbun, Japan \u2019s newspaper.  Would you expand on the\u2014on your views on the downside risks \u2014downside risks, especially in regard to trade issues?  Many people are\u2014in the key allies of the United States \u2014are concerned that the United States may destabilize the underpinnings of the international liberal order the United States has created and built up in the postwar environment.  So \u2014and that will, of course, have a very negative economic implications for the global economy as well as the U.S. economy.  So would you\u2014have you \u2014can I have your views on that? CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Sure.  So, you know, as I mentioned earlier, I\u2019 m really committed to staying in our lane on things.  We have very important jobs assigned to us by Congress and that\u2019 s maximum employment, stable prices, financial stability.  Trade is explicitly assigned to the executive branch by Congress and not to us.  So we don\u2019 t really \u2014we don\u2019 t really seek to play a role in trade policy.  We\u2019 re not at that table.  Those are\u2014those powers and decisions are given to others and so we want to stick to what we do.  And, you know, I\u2014as I mentioned earlier, we do hear from our business contacts, which are extensive in the United States, and we do report on that in the minutes, and I\u2019 ve just mentioned what those are.  There is \u2014there is concern that trade changes could be disruptive.  And I also\u2014as I also mentioned, we don\u2019t see it in th e numbers yet.  We really don\u2019 t.  We see a very strong economy across a bunch of fronts.  It hasn\u2019 t reached everyone, let \u2019s be clear on that.  But most people who want a job can\n\nJune 13,\n\nfind one .  We\u2019re well aware that there are pockets out there of people who hav e not felt the recession yet, but, broadly speaking, it\u2019s a good economy.1 STEVEN BECKNER.  Steve Beckner, Mr. Chairman, freelance journalist reporting for NPR.  About financial conditions, which worries you more\u2014warnings that rising short- term rates are b ringing the yield curve closer to inversion, or the fact that long rates have risen very slowly and, in fact, are nearly 20  basis points below their recent high?  How do you account for the fact that long rates have been so slow to rise?  And what does it say about the inflation outlook as well? CHAIRMAN POWELL.  So let me \u2014let me briefly mention the yield curve.  I mean, I \u2014 the yield curve is something that people are talking about a lot, including FOMC participants.  And I \u2014you have a range of views.  It\u2019 s something we\u2019re going to continue to be talking about. It\u2019s\u2014but it\u2019s only one of many things, of course, that we talk about.  I think that that discussion is really about what is appropriate policy, and how do we think about policy as we approach the neutral rate.  How do we understand what the neutral rate is?  How do we know where it is?  And what are the consequences of being above or below it?  That \u2019s really what \u2014when people are talking about the slope of the yield curve, that\u2019 s really what they \u2019re talk ing about.  We know why\u2014we know why the yield curve is flattening.  It\u2019 s because we \u2019re raising the federal funds rate.  It makes all the sense in the world tha t the short end would come up. I think you asked\u2014the harder question is, what\u2019s happening with long rates?  And there are many things that move long rates around.  Of course, there\u2019 s an embedded expectation of the path of short rates.  There\u2019s the term premium, which has been very low by historical standards.  And so arguments are made that a flatter yield curve has less of a signal embedded in it.  In\n\nJune 13,\n\naddition, I think what you saw most recently that you referred to, Steve, was just risk -on, risk - off.  In a risk-off environment, people want to own U.S. Treasuries , and you see\u2014you know, Treasury prices go up, rates go down quite a lot.  So\u2014but I think ultimately, you know, what we\u2019re\u2014what we really care about is what \u2019s the appropriate stance of  policy.  And there\u2019 s a\u2014 there may be a signal in that long-term rate about what is the neutral rate, and I think that\u2019 s why people are paying attention to the yield curve. NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  Nancy Marshall -Genzer with Marketplace. Companies are buyin g back their shares at a record rate.  Corporate debt is up.  Consumer debt is rising.  Are we in a credit bubble?  Is that something that you\u2019 re worried about? CHAIRMAN POWELL.  So if you look at households, you do not see excess credit growth , you don\u2019 t see high levels of credit going out.  So not so much households.  And that really was where the problems were before the financial crisis , was particularly in \u2014among household borrowing, particularly around mortgages.  With\u2014if you take banks, then, of cours e, their leverage is significantly lower.  Or, to say it differently, their capital is significantly higher.  If you ask about nonfinancial corporates, that\u2019 s really where leverage is at levels that are high relative to history.  But defaults are low, inte rest rates are low, you know, so it\u2019s something\u2014 that\u2019s something we\u2019re watching very carefully.  But, again, I don\u2019 t think we see it as \u2014I think there are a range of views on that, but we are watching nonfinancial corporates.  Households are in good shape, though, and that is\u2014that is so important because that\u2019 s where \u2014you know, that\u2019 s where we got into trouble before.  And that\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s often around property, and particularly housing, where you see real problems emerge.  We don\u2019 t really see that now, so we take some solace from that.\n\nJune 13,\n\nMYLES UDLAND.  Myles Udland with Yahoo Finance.  Chair Powell, you referenced a minute ago this idea of cushion, or the fact that the Fed doesn\u2019 t have as much of when rates are low and inflation is low.  And I\u2019m wondering if you or the Committee has thought about your move to raise interest rates as partly responding to the economy, but partly giving yourselves room to navigate in the inevitable future recession, whenever that was to come.  And do you think that that has played any part in, you know, your outlook for policy or recent policy decisions?  Or is it, you know, just a purely based on what the economy is doing? CHAIRMAN POWELL.  So it doesn \u2019t play any part in my thinking and I\u2019 ll tell you why. If you raise rates too quickly , you\u2019re just increasing the likelihood of a recession, and that\u2019 s exactly what you don\u2019t want to do.  So the best thing you can do, I think\u2014I think the incentives actually run in the other direction.  If you\u2019 re\u2014if you \u2019re worried about going back to the lower bound, then risk management would suggest that you go a little slower in raising rates and tolerate \u2014that \u2019s likely to be a more sustainable strategy to get further away from the zero lower bound.  I think we\u2019re far enough away now, though, that the risks are kind of balanced.  And so I think it\u2019s more just\u2014we \u2019re just looking at the economy, and what does it need, and how do we\u2014 how do we sustain the expansion, keep the labor market strong, and try to keep inflation near 2 percent? MARK HAMRICK.  Mark Hamr ick with Bankrate.  You talked earlier about wage growth and your basic message to workers.  How confident are you that when we do see stock buybacks and the like, the workers will get whatever your view of that share is as well and the wage hikes in the near term and in the foreseeable future?  Thank you. CHAIRMAN POWELL.  You know, we don\u2019t\u2014we don\u2019t have the tools to control that. If companies choose to\u2014companies in our system are free to do what they can\u2014what they need\n\nJune 13,\n\nto do once they\u2019ve\u2014once they\u2019 ve made profits and have cash to distribute.  They can distribute it to their shareholders, they can buy\u2014either through dividends or through buybacks.  They can pay their workers.  You know, the part\u2014and, you know, we don\u2019t play a role in those decisions.  The part that we focus on is maximum employment.  That\u2019s our mandate.  So we view maximum employment as the maximum sustainable level of employment, meaning it \u2019s not so much that it will cause the economy to overheat.  And so I think we\u2019 ve been committed to that.  I think we take that obligation very seriously.  And, you know, over time, when\u2014 when labor markets are strong and companies are hiring, we should see higher wages.  But, again, we don\u2019 t really have the tools that will address the distribution of profits and that kind of thing."

    "text": "September 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll\u2019s Press Conference FINAL Transcript of Chairman Powell\u2019s Press Conference September 26, 2018 CHAIRMAN POWELL: Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks f or being here.  I am going to start with an overview of how  my colleagues and I see the ec onomy, what we decided today, and then a bit about our expecta tions for the months ahead. Our economy is strong. Growth is running at a healthy clip.  U nemployment is low, the number of people working is ri sing steadily, and wages are up. Inflation is low and stable. All of these are very good signs. Of co urse, that\u2019s not to say tha t everything is perfect.  The benefits of this strong economy have not  reached all Americans.  Many of  our country\u2019s economic challenges are beyond the scope of  the Fed, but my colleagues and I are doing all we can to keep the economy strong, healthy, and moving forward.  That is the b est way we can promote an environment in which every American has the opportunity to succ eed. Each time my colleagues and I meet, we face the same question: How can we set policy to best support job growth and low , steady inflation?  For many  years, this question called for very low interest rates to hel p an economy that had been damage d by the deep financial crisis that gripped the world 10 years ago.  As the economy has steadi ly gained strength, the Fed has been gradually returning interest rates closer to levels that a re normal in a healthy economy.  We took another step on that path toda y with a quarter-point incre ase in short-term interest rates. These rates remain low, and my c olleagues and I believe that th is gradual return to normal is helping to sustain this strong economy for the longer-run benef it of all Americans. As I mentioned, 10 years have now passed since the depths of th e financial crisis\u2014a painful part of our history that cost many Americans their jobs , their homes, and, for some, their hopes and dreams.  In addition to holding interest rates low to  support the recovery, we have also taken many steps to make the financial system safer.  In partic ular, we\u2019re holding the largest\n\nSeptember 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll\u2019s Press Conference FINAL banks to much higher standards in  the amount of capital and liq uidity they hold and in the ways they assess and manage the risks  they take.  I am confident tha t the system today is stronger and in a far better position to suppor t the financial needs of households and businesses through good times and bad.  We continue to work to sustain these fundamental improvements while also ensuring that regulation is  both effective and efficient. Now, let me go into more detail a bout the developments that mot ivated today\u2019s policy decision. Both household spending a nd business investment are expanding briskly, and the overall growth outlook remains favorable.  And several factors support this assessment:  Fiscal policy is boosting the econom y, ongoing job gains are raising i ncomes and confidence, and overall financial conditions remain accommodative.  These condi tions are consistent with our Summary of Economic Projections  for this meeting.  The median o f Committee participants\u2019 projections for the growth of r eal GDP is 3.1 percent this year  and 2.5 percent next year. Job gains averaged 185,000 per month over the last three months , well above the pace needed in the longer run to provi de jobs for new entrants to th e labor force.  The unemployment rate stood at 3.9 percen t in August and has been near that leve l since April.  Smoothing through month-to-month variations, the la bor force participation rate r emains about where it was in late 2013\u2014a positive sign, given that the aging of our population is  putting downward pressure on participation. We expect the job market to remain strong.  And the median of Committee participants\u2019 projections for the unemployment rate later this year is 3.7 percent and a bit lower than that in 2019. Overall consumer prices, as m easured by the price index for per sonal consumption expenditures (PCE inflation), increased 2.3 percent over the 12  months ending in July.  The core price index, which excludes the prices of energy and food and t ends to be a better indicator of\n\nSeptember 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll\u2019s Press Conference FINAL future inflation, rose 2 percent over the same period.  The FOM C seeks, and expects to see, inflation remaining near our 2 percent longer-run objective on a sustained basis.  At any given time, inflation may be somewhat above or below 2 percent.  For example, the recent rise in oil prices has pushed inflation a little above 2 percent, but we ex pect this to be transitory, as is reflected in our projections. The median projections for both the overall and core inflation measures remain very close to 2 pe rcent across the whole projection horizon. Today the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by \u00bc percentage point, bringing it to 2 to 2\u00bc percen t.  This action reflects th e strength we see in the economy and is one more step in the process that we began almost three year s ago of gradually returning interest rates to more normal levels.  Looking ahead, today\u2019s projections show gradual interest rate increases continuing roughly as foreseen in June.  The med ian of participants\u2019 views on appropriate policy through 2020 are  unchanged since the June me eting. These projections play an impor tant role in our work.  My colle agues and I believe that it\u2019s useful to communicate our v iews on likely prospects for th e economy and for policy.  We are well aware, however, that the ec onomy regularly surprises, and that even the most carefully constructed projections are high ly uncertain.  The projections about the appropriate path of policy assume that the economy evo lves broadly in line with the  projections for growth, employment, unemployment, and inflation.  If the economy were i nstead to falter , lower interest rates would be appropriate. Conve rsely, if inflationary pressu res were to rise more than expected, higher inte rest rates would be appropriate.  Right no w, as our statement indicates, risks to the economic outlook a ppear roughly balanced. Readers of the FOMC statement likely noted that the Committee d ropped a sentence that indicated that \u201cthe stance of m onetary policy remains accommodative.\u201d  This change does not\n\nSeptember 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll\u2019s Press Conference FINAL signal any change in the likely pa th of policy; instead, it is a sign that policy is proceeding in line with our expectations.  We still expect, as our statement says,  \u201cfurther gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate,\u201d and this expectation is reflected in the  projections that I just discussed. Thanks very much.  I\u2019m happy to take your ques tions. NICK TIMIRAOS. Thank you. Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, given the lags of monetary pol icy, I want to know how you think  about ending the tightening cycle?  How will you know when to stop?  And do you need to kee p going until something in the economy breaks? CHAIRMAN POWELL. So the tight ening cycle, as you know, is a re flection of the strength of the economy.  And it\u2019 s almost three years now that we\u2019ve been gradually raising rates. And I think the fact tha t we have moved quite gradually , in a way, allows us to carefully watch incoming data in the real economy and in the financial ma rkets to see how the economy is processing higher interest rat es.  And the fact that we\u2019re movi ng so gradually\u2014I think it\u2014I think it limits the long and variable lags problem because, you know,  we\u2019re being able to raise rates and then wait and see how the econo my absorbs these rate increa ses.  And so far, the economy has performed very well and very much in keeping with our expec tations. JIM PUZZANGHERA.  Hi, Jim Puzzanghera from the L.A. Times.   President Trump has stated publicly he\u2019s not thrilled with the interest rate hikes.  His comments didn\u2019t appear to have any impact on you or your colleagues.  Were his comments discussed at your meeting?  And do you have any concerns about the eff ect of these types of commen ts on the perception of the Fed\u2019s independence and your monetary policy? CHAIRMAN POWELL. So we\u2019ve been gi ven a really important job to  do on behalf of the American people by Congress , and we\u2019ve been given the tools  to do it, and my colleagues\n\nSeptember 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll\u2019s Press Conference FINAL and I are focused exclusively on carrying out that mission.  We consider the best thinking, the best theory, and the be st evidence.  We have  disparate points o f view, which we debate extensively and come to a perspe ctive and try to set monetary p olicy to achieve maximum employment in a context of pri ce stability.  That\u2019s what we do.   We don\u2019t consider political factors or things like that. A nd so that\u2019s who we are, that\u2019s what we do, and that\u2019s just the way it\u2019s always going to be for us. STEVE LIESMAN. Steve Liesman, CNBC.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Can you explain how\u2014the stock market be ing at a near all-time high, cor porate spreads being very tight\u2014how does the level of the market factor into your decisio ns to raise interest rates?  Is there a concern on your part? And then, as sort of a second and rela ted part, can you tell us what happens in 2020 and 2021 that\u2014I know you can\u2019t tell us when you \u2019re shaking your head [laughter]\u2014that prompts\u2014that pr ompts you\u2014the Fed to think that the rates need to still be above neutral in that time period?  Thank you. CHAIRMAN POWELL. Sure. So in ter ms of financial markets and m onetary policy, we\u2014as we say in our statement every cycle, we do take financial conditions into consideration because financial\u2014broader financial conditions do affect the br oader economy, and they\u2019re one of the many things that we tak e into account.  T he part of it t hat we control, though, is what we do with the federal funds rate a nd that has\u2014that has effects ou t through, you know, out through the full interest rate curve a nd into financial asset prices ge nerally.  So the answer is, we take everything into account, but, you know, broader financial condi tions are just one of the things that we take into account. In terms of \u201920 and \u201921, why\u2014your que stion was why the funds ra te needs to be above neutral?  So you\u2019re right. Some  of\u2014some of the participants have mostly very modest\n\nSeptember 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll\u2019s Press Conference FINAL overshoots of their personal estimates of neutral a couple\u2014thre e years out.  You know, it\u2019s far out into the future. I think it\u2019 s hard to be confident that th at\u2019s\u2014that that\u2019s t he way things are going to be. What we\u2019re going to be  doing as we\u2014as we go throu gh time is asking at every meeting whether monetary polic y is set to achieve our goals.  And I think that that\u2019s an assessment of where policy will  need to be some years down the road, and I\u2019ll leave it at that. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thanks. Howar d Schneider with Reuters.  Cha ir Powell, I think\u2014is this too good to be true?  Because you\u2019ve got four years here of unemployment below 4 percent\u2014very low, substantiall y below NAIRU, what appears to be NAIRU\u2014but no reaction of inflation there. And so I don\u2019t think that\u2019s ever happened since the 1960s.  Why do you think it\u2019s going to happen now?  Or in the alternative, is this forec ast for unemployment just being driven by your confidence interva ls to the extent that, well, w e don\u2019t know what else to do, so just extend the lie out\u2014line out until something happens? CHAIRMAN POWELL. No, you\u2019re right .  The Committee forecasts wh at they\u2014what they show, in general, is an economy where unemployment remains  in the high and middle 3s throughout the entire forecast period and inflation remains ver y close to 2 percent.  That is what the forecast shows.  And that is based on our understanding of the way the inflation process works now and on the fact that the inflation seems to be fairly  nonreactive to changes in slack\u2014 that is to say, a flat Phillips curve.  And it\u2019s just\u2014it\u2019s a\u2014it\u2019s a world of strongly anchored inflation expectations.  And that\u2019s not just our forecast, that \u2019s many forecasts.  So that is\u2014that is \u2014that is the forecast.  So you may ask\u2014I mean, the sense is, what does the longer-run natural rate of unemployment mean?  And s o that really is a longer-run concept that we think the economy will return to over the longer run.  But, obviously, that longer run, you know, isn\u2019t\u2014 it\u2019s not creating problems in the  short run for that forecast.\n\nSeptember 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll\u2019s Press Conference FINAL Now let\u2019s just admit that the i nflation process  has changed dra matically from where it was in the 1960s to where it is now.  It\u2019s in a good place now.   We can\u2019t take for granted that it will remain the way it is, and, you know, we will be, of course , watching carefu lly.  If inflation reacts more strongly or more weak ly to the strong economy, then  we\u2019ll adjust policy appropriately. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. If I coul d follow up on that, what are you buying with interest rates? CHAIRMAN POWELL. Well, interes t rates, of course, have effects  on growth, have effects\u2014I mean if\u2014I guess the \u2014your question was, what are you buying with by raising interest rates? The question is, what  would the economy look like if yo u didn\u2019t raise ra tes?  It would look very different, I think, if we didn\u2019t raise rates. We\u2019re always trying to, you know, w ork our way between the\u2014sort of the two\u2014the two problems we face.  One is that  if we move too quickly, we can, you know, snuff out a recovery unnecessarily, and inflation falls short of its 2 percent targe t.  Or if we move too slowly, we have an economy that can overheat.  So w e\u2019re\u2014that\u2014that\u2019s happened th rough history.  We don\u2019t see any signs of that now, but we\u2019re a lways trying to navigate betw een those two shoals.  And we think that gradually, you know, rai sing interest rates is the way that we kind of take both of those risks seriously. SAM FLEMING.  Thanks very much.  Sam Fleming from the Financial Times.  The Fed has recently been saying that fin ancial stability risks are mod erate.  What kind of developments could prompt a change in that asse ssment to elevated risks?  And is there an argument for moving the countercyclical capita l buffer, even when risks are moderate, rather than waiting until the risks are seen as elevated, which, arguably, could be  too late?  Thanks.\n\nSeptember 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll\u2019s Press Conference FINAL CHAIRMAN POWELL. So I think one of  the most important lessons from the financial crisis is really the importan ce of the stability of the financi al system.  And so we\u2014since the financial crisis, as you\u2019re aw are, we\u2019ve had a major focus on b uilding up our monitoring of financial conditions and financial  stability issues.  We\u2019ve als o put in place many, many initiatives to strengthen the f inancial system through higher c apital and better re gulation, more transparency, central clearing, margins on uncleared derivatives, all kinds of things like that, which are meant to strengthen the  financial system.  We\u2019ve done many of those things, and we feel that the financial system is in a much better place. As we look at\u2014as we look at conditions most recently\u2014and this was at our last meeting, and it was in our minutes for the last meeting\u2014quarterly, we ha ve a briefing at the FOMC, and also at the Board, of the staffs\u2019  views on financial stability,  and the staff judged the overall vulnerabilities to be moderate .  If you dig into the different aspects of that que stion, households or balance sheets are in good sha pe.  You know, employment is h igh, wages are rising, that sort of thing. The banking system, as I mentioned, is\u2014you know, muc h higher capital, much higher liquidity\u2014is much stronger.  I f you look at asset prices, it is  true that some asset prices are in the upper range of their historical \u2014upper reach of their historical ranges.  And then if you look at nonfinancial corporates, you get\u2014th ere is the story of leverage there.  So it\u2019s not that there aren\u2019t any vulnerabilities, but we see them as moderate. Now, you ask about the countercyc lical capital buffer.  The cou ntercyclical capital buffer is a tool that we added to our  toolkit, I think, finally, back in 2016.  We said that we would deploy it when vulnerabilities were meaningfully above normal.  We revisit that on a regular schedule, and the last time we r evisited it was, I think, last year\u2014sometime last year\u2014and concluded that the test was not  met.  As I mentioned at the las t briefing, the\u2014you know, the\n\nSeptember 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll\u2019s Press Conference FINAL assessment was that vulnerabili ties were moderate, but it remains a kit\u2014a tool for our toolkit that we can deploy, you know, when and as we feel appropriate. SAM FLEMING.  Has the chance of  needing to deploy it increased? CHAIRMAN POWELL. As I said, I think I\u2019m in the camp of seeing vulnerabilities as relatively moderate. I think the f inancial system\u2014I think another thing that we learned in the crisis is that we need to be alert to the buildup of vulnerabil ities as a long expansion continues.  I don\u2019t see that in troubling\u2014troubl ing amounts at this point, but, you know, I think it\u2019s appropriate for us to monitor that very carefully. MARTY CRUTSINGER. Marty Crutsi nger, Associated Press.  The researchers at the European Central Bank this wee k put out a paper saying that the  impact of a trade war on the U.S. could be dire, that the  U.S. economy could drop by 2 perce nt in the first year after a widespread trade war. Could you talk about the discussion you\u2019ve had\u2014your policy statement, does it mention the trade ten sions?  You did not mention them.  What do you\u2014what kind of outlook do you have right now for the trade war? CHAIRMAN POWELL. Sure. So I gue ss I need to start by saying t hat we\u2019re not responsible for trade polic y, and we don\u2019t comment on particula r, you know, trade actions and that sort of thing.  But you will ha ve seen that we have this v ery extensive network of business contacts around the country through the Reserve Banks largely, and we\u2019ve been hearing a rising chorus of concerns from businesse s all over the country about d isruption of supply chains, materials costs and increases, and loss of markets, and things like that.  So we\u2019ve been hearing quite a lot of that, and we\u2014the Reserve Bank presidents talk ab out it in the meeting, and it goes in the minutes.  So we, you know, tha t\u2019s\u2014we\u2019re very transparent  about hearing a ll that.  I think if you look at the aggregate perfor m\u2014the performance of the U.S . economy at an aggregate\u2014at\n\nSeptember 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll\u2019s Press Conference FINAL a national level, it\u2019s hard to see much happening at this point.  And\u2014or you can look at it the other way: You can ask, if all  of the tariffs that have been a nnounced are applied, what would be the effect at the aggregate le vel?  And they\u2019re still relativel y small. You know, we worry about a couple of things.  One is loss of business confidence, which could reduce investment.  Agai n, we don\u2019t really see effects th at we could measure yet.  Also, the possibility of a financial market reaction over time to une xpected trade developments.  More than anything, though, I would worry, in the longer run, where this is going, you know.  If the\u2014 if the end place we get to is lower tariffs, that would be good , you know.  Trade generally supports productivity, supports higher incomes.  And, you know,  fair trade\u2014fair trade under internationally accepted rules can be a good thing.  I think if  this, perhaps inadvertently, goes to a place where we have widespread tariffs that remain in place for  a long time\u2014a more protectionist world\u2014that\u2019s goi ng to be bad for the United States\u2019 economy and for American workers, and families, and also for other economies. HEATHER LONG.  Hi, Heather Long from the Washington Post.  This is the third time this year that the FOMC has raised its growth forecasts.  I\u2019m w ondering if you could share a little bit about what\u2019s causing that rise and whether you see supply-s ide effects coming through from the fiscal policy\u2014fiscal stimulus yet.  Thanks. CHAIRMAN POWELL. So it\u2019s true. This year has\u2014we\u2019ve kept raisi ng our forecast for this year. This\u2014as the year\u2019s gone on, the economy has come in stronger than we expected, and that\u2019s a really good thing. And the  economy, as I mentioned at  the beginning, is strong, and there\u2019s good reason to expect that to continue.  You ask why.  You know, some of it is, no doubt, the effect of the fiscal policy c hanges, the tax cuts, and the spending increases\u2014that\u2019s got to be part of the story. Part of it may be higher oil prices, which are calling for more investment in the\n\nSeptember 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll\u2019s Press Conference FINAL oil patch. But, you know, the growt h picture is very much supported by very high readings of household confidence, business c onfidence, so it\u2019s a\u2014it\u2019s a\u2014it\u2019 s a\u2014it\u2019s a pretty particularly bright moment, I think.  If you look back over the last decade, this is a pretty good moment for the U.S. economy. HEATHER LONG. And the supply-side effects? CHAIRMAN POWELL. Oh, supply- side effects, yeah.  So, you know,  we hope they\u2019re huge, frankly. You know, the idea is, you cut\u2014you reduce taxation on corporations and particularly\u2014and allow faster expensing for investment.  The id ea is to encourage more investment, and that is one of the things that drives productivity, which is one of the main things that drives rising incomes.  So t he effects are very uncertain,  they\u2019re\u2014you know, they\u2019re\u2014the literature is\u2014it\u2019s\u2014there\u2019s no cl ear answer to exactly how these  mechanisms work or how effective they are. And it w ould be soon to be seeing supply-s ide effects.  The other\u2014supply- side effects are probably both more uncertain and they\u2019re proba bly slower to come in.  But, you know, as I said, we\u2014I certainly hop e\u2014I hope that we\u2019ll be marki ng up our estimates of potential growth as well. CRAIG TORRES. Craig Torres from Bloomberg News.  Taking a page  from your risk- management approach in Jackson H ole, Mr. Chairman, I\u2019m wonderin g if you can talk about what risks would make the Committee \u2014plausible risks\u2014go faster in 201 9.  What risks would make them go slower?  If you could talk about scenarios. And then I\u2019d like to ask, do you see yourself, as this stimulus tails off, which it does in the forecast, poss ibly cutting rates to soft-land the economy?  I know the forecast doesn \u2019t show that, but I\u2019m curiou s how you soft-land without doing that.\n\nSeptember 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll\u2019s Press Conference FINAL CHAIRMAN POWELL. Okay, so I thi nk I mentioned in the opening r emarks maybe something that addressed your question about what would make us  go faster and slower.  You know, the main thing where we mi ght need to move along a little  bit quicker would be if inflation\u2014inflation s urprises to the upsid e.  We don\u2019t see that.  We really don\u2019t see that.  It\u2019s not in our forecast, but any\u2014so I woul d\u2014I regard that as a risk.  I  think either a significant\u2014 significant\u2014correction and lasting correction in financial mark ets or a slowing down in the economy that\u2019s inconsistent wit h our forecast\u2014those are the kin ds of things we\u2019d react to. In terms of what, you know, what we would do\u2014you know, I think we\u2019re always going to be adjusting monetary policy to\u2014in light of conditions on th e ground.  So if the economy is weakening, then it\u2019s very possible we\u2019d be\u2014we\u2019d be cutting rate s and, you know, vice versa. And so I can\u2019t rule that out. I t\u2014I think it\u2019s  quite difficult,  though, to know what the effects\u2014 what the sort of end effects of  fiscal policy are going to be i n 2020.  It\u2019s difficult to know what the policy will be, let alone what their effects will be that f ar out.  So we have to make estimates, but we know that they\u2019re highly uncertain. EDWARD LAWRENCE. Edward Lawre nce from Fox Business.  Thank you , Chairman. The unemployment rate is now at  3.9 percent.  The average hourly wages rose 2.9 percent for the past 12 months.  Inflation, according to your numbers, holding steady.  The amount of job vacancies that we have out there and the number of people coming back into the workforce this year\u2014where is the point at whic h, then, we are actually above the natural rate of unemployment and the Federal Reserve should r eexamine the consistency of the rate hikes going forward so not to cool an expanding economy? CHAIRMAN POWELL. You mean\u2014you mean, where\u2019s the point at which  inflation\u2014 unemployment is too low?  Y eah.  Yeah. You know, so we\u2019ve been \u2014I think the perform\u2014labor\n\nSeptember 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll\u2019s Press Conference FINAL force participation has surpri sed us on the upside.  There is a  long-run trend there, and we\u2019ve now had basically five flat  years.  If you look\u2014if you look at labor force participation, since the fourth quarter of \u201913 till now, you really have a\u2014kind of an oscillation that basically is a sideways movement in the face of  a significant downward trend, thanks to aging and other factors. That\u2019s a gain of well more than a percentage point in  participation, so that\u2019s really\u2014 that\u2019s really a good thing. Those are people who are remaining  in contact with the labor force and looking for jobs, finding jobs .  So that\u2019s a great thing. And, by the way, it\u2019s a signal. It\u2019 s one of the things that ha s allowed the unemployment rate not to fall further. And it\u2019 s a\u2014it\u2019s a signal, too, that there may be more there on the supply side, that there may be more labo r supply than th e prior trend would indicate.  So it\u2019s a very positive thing to see people staying in the labor force.  And, you know, we don\u2019t know how long it can continue. We have models, and we look at this\u2014we look a t this question all the time. And, you know, admittedly, we\u2019ve been surprised on the positive  side here, so we\u2019re open to the idea that that may continue or not. DONNA BORAK. Hi, Chair. Donna Bor ak with CNN.  Just to follow  up on the tariff question, you said earlier that it seems as the effects of the tariff so far haven\u2019t quite materialized\u2014those weren\u2019t your w ords verbat[im]\u2014but Wal-Mart, Gap, Coca-Cola, General Motors, Macy\u2019s have all said that they expect the tariffs to af fect the prices of everyday consumer goods.  So my question is, when\u2014should there be an eff ect\u2014when would you expect to see that?  And at what point  do you start to become worried that it\u2019s actual ly going to affect consumer spending and dampening economic growth? CHAIRMAN POWELL. It\u2019s a concern.  It\u2019s a risk. You know, so y ou could see prices moving up. You don\u2019t see it yet, but we\u2014you could see retail p rices moving up.  The tariffs\n\nSeptember 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll\u2019s Press Conference FINAL might provide a basis for companie s to raise prices in a world where they\u2019ve been very reluctant to and unable to raise prices, whe re raising prices is really d ifficult, you know, with the ability to shop on the internet. This coul d provide, you know, a way for\u2014 again, we don\u2019t see it in the numbers.  And, you know, until we see it in the numbers, it\u2019s h ard to say how one would react. And the other question would be, if you\u2019re just talking about the effect on inflati on is, is it just a one-time increase in the price level, or is it actually fueling  higher inflation going forward?  And that\u2019s a real\u2014that\u2019s an importa nt question in, in how we would think about the appropriate response. DONNA BORAK. But is there a sens e of timing, in terms of when you might see that kick in, the effect of? CHAIRMAN POWELL. Don\u2019t see it yet.  You know, don\u2019t see it yet, but we\u2014you\u2019re hearing\u2014I mean, broadly across the economy, it\u2019s not just tarif fs.  You\u2019re hearing\u2014we\u2019re hearing a lot of talk of labor s hortages, of material costs in particular industries.  We\u2019re hearing a lot, you know, what amount to supply -side constraints and things like that, but we\u2019re not seeing it. We\u2019re seeing a sort of modest  increase in wages, inflation  right around 2 percent, no sense of it moving up really, so we\u2019re not seeing it yet.  And, you know , we just aren\u2019t, and we\u2019re watching very carefully. MICHAEL MCKEE. Mr. Chairman, Michael McKee, Bloomberg Radio and Television. Financial conditions are still extremely loose by all the measu res that track that.  The flow of funds shows the decline in short-term borrowing other than in T reasuries.  So I\u2019m wondering if that suggests a change in the wa y that tightening affects the e conomy.  And along those lines, you mentioned that you dropped the word \u201caccommodative\u201d doesn\u2019t  suggest a change in policy. But if you\u2019re dropping forward guidance in terms of \u201caccommodat ive,\u201d does the do t plot really\n\nSeptember 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll\u2019s Press Conference FINAL serve any purpose anymore if , as you say, you can\u2019t be confident out to 2021 what\u2019s going to happen with the economy? CHAIRMAN POWELL. A couple questions in there.  So the dot plot \u2014I mean, I\u2014it\u2019s not new. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a new point that forecasts two and  three out\u2014two or three years out are fairly uncertain. The dot plot  is individual FOMC particip ants who are writing down their individual views on the evolu tion of the economy and of appropr iate monetary policy.  We don\u2019t vote on that.  These are individual forecasts.  I think market participants generally find that interesting information, and so it seems to me to be serving a purpose. I think the point with \u201caccommodative\u201d was that its useful life  was over.  You know, we put that in the statement in 2015, just when we lifted off, and  the idea was to provide assurance that we weren\u2019t trying to slo w down the economy, but, in fact, we were still\u2014interest rates were still going to be pushing to suppor t economic activity.  Well, that\u2014you know, that purpose has been well served, and the language now doesn\u2019t really say anyth ing that\u2019s important to the way the Committee is thinking about policy going forward.  That\u2019s w hy that came out.  Did I get\u2014 did I get all of your ques\u2014? MICHAEL MCKEE. The idea that f inancial conditions remain loose  even though you raised rates 200 basis points? CHAIRMAN POWELL. Yeah, you know, it\u2019s\u2014if you look at a broad f inancial conditions index, that\u2019s pretty m uch the answer you\u2019ll get.  We  don\u2019t control that, and, as I mentioned earlier, we do take fi nancial conditions into account in what we do.  And financial conditions are affecting the broader economy, so, by definition, we\u2019re taking them into account. But if you look at\u2014look at interest rates, you know, interest r ates\u2014look at long-term interest rates this year and short-term int erest rates this year, there\u2019 s very significant increases.  And, you\n\nSeptember 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll\u2019s Press Conference FINAL know, with your long and variable lag s, that should be\u2014that sho uld be having an effect over time. VICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, V ictoria Guida with Politico.  So Nellie L iang was just put forward by President Donald Trum p to the Fed Board, and I was j ust curious, you know, given that she\u2019s a longtime veteran of the Fed, whether you could spe ak to what role you played in, you know, recommending candidates to the President, giving input on who he should nominate.  And then also, if I\u2014if I may follo w up on the financial stability d iscussion from earlier, you know, you\u2019ve mentioned before that corpor ate debt is at high levels, and I was curious whether, you know, you have any qualms about loosening up restrictions on le veraged lending by making that guidance less of a\u2014less of a cudgel, I guess, while\u2014at a time when leveraged lending is gaining steam? CHAIRMAN POWELL. Okay, so in terms of nominations to the Fed, those are entirely, completely under the control of  the White House and, ultimately , the President.  And traditionally, the Fed Chair has been consulted on those, and I \u2019m happy to say that that has continued. But these are\u2014these are really decisions for the Wh ite House, and, you know, we are\u2014think of us as just being c onsulted.  I will say that I\u2019m v ery happy and excited about the team that we\u2019re putting together , and I\u2019m very much looking forward to having those offices up and down our hall filled.  It\u2019s b een pretty quiet, more quieter  than usual, which is saying something on the Board hall.  S o we\u2019re looking forward to getti ng some people confirmed. In terms of corporate debt, so t his is a\u2014this is a\u2014you know, I was an investor for a long time in areas that were very clo se to the leveraged lending markets.  So, you know, I have had a lot of experience in that. That m arket has evolved really sign ificantly since before the crisis. And, you know, the banks take much l ess risk than they used to.  They\u2019re\u2014the\u2014they\u2019re\n\nSeptember 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll\u2019s Press Conference FINAL essentially in the business of distributing these loans and bon ds rather than keeping them on their balance sheet, to a much greater  degree.  But it\u2019s also true\u2014an d there\u2019s significant research on this\u2014that excessive risk-taking in the leveraged lending market s does have channels for affecting the real economy, if there\u2019s overheating and that kin d of thing in those markets, so we monitor that carefully. You know , the guidance is \u2014isn\u2019t binding, as you pointed out, that the leveraged lending isn\u2019t binding, a nd that\u2019s just\u2014that\u2019s just th e way that the law is interpreted. So it\u2019s something we\u2019re monito ring, and, as I mentioned, we think overall vulnerabilities are moderate. BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.  Binya Appelbaum, the New York Times.   If I could come back to \u201caccommodative,\u201d do you think of policy as accommodativ e at present?  How close are you to neutrality, and do you share t he view of some of your co lleagues that you\u2019ll eventually need to be restrictive? CHAIRMAN POWELL. Okay, so are we accommodative now?  So I thin k if you look at the\u2014look at the dot plot in the S EP, you\u2019ll see that the federa l funds rate, even after today\u2019s move, is below the longer-run neu tral estimate of every single participant that\u2014who submits a\u2014 an estimate of that.  So that\u2019s why this is the perfect time to take the language out, because, you know, it\u2019s perfectly clear that there can\u2019t be a signal because, you know, by definition, that means an accommodative policy.  So it wasn\u2019t because policy is not accommodative.  It is still accommodative.  The thinking was more, as I mentioned, it\u2019s mor e that the language has run its useful life. There\u2019s another point, th ough, too, which is, you know, we don\u2019 t want to suggest either that we have this precise understanding of where \u201caccommodative \u201d stops or suggest that that\u2019s a really important point in our  thinking.  You know, what we\u2019re g oing to be doing, assuming we\n\nSeptember 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll\u2019s Press Conference FINAL stay on this path, is, we\u2019re going to be carefully monitoring i ncoming data from the financial markets and from the economy a nd asking ourselves whether our policy is achieving the goals we want to achieve\u2014you know, sustai n the economy, maximum emplo yment, stable prices. That\u2019s the way we\u2019re thinking about it, and that does kind of a mount to thinking less about one\u2019s precise point estimate of the ne utral rate.  So that\u2019s how I think about that. BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.  The second question was, do you think you\u2019 re going to end up in a restrictive posture?  Gove rnor Brainard, for example, has said that she expects that you will need to do that. Do you agree with that? CHAIRMAN POWELL. It\u2019s possible. It\u2019s very possible.  It happens often.  And, as I mentioned, many of the participan ts have written that down, and  they\u2019ve written down really modest overshoots, you know, amoun ting to one rate hike kind of  thing, which wouldn\u2019t have a big effect on the economy. You know, it\u2014I would just say, you know, it really depends on w hat happens.  It depends on if we keep going\u2014you can t hink of it different ways.   Maybe we\u2019ve underestimated the neutral rate. Maybe we\u2019ll  be raising our estimate of the n eutral rate and we\u2019 ll just go to that, or maybe we\u2019ll keep our neutral rate here and then go one or tw o rate increases beyond it.  I think it\u2019s very possible, but I mean, ultimately, isn\u2019t really the question we\u2019re  answering.  The question we\u2019re answering is, how  do we provide the economy just the right amount of support\u2014 not too much, not too little\u2014to susta in the recovery and achieve our statutory goals? GREG ROBB. Thank you, Mr. Chairma n.  Greg Robb from MarketWatc h.  The 10-year anniversary of the bankruptcy of  Lehman Brothers got a lot of attention over the last month.  I was wondering if you thought there w ere any lessons from the cr isis that you want to share\u2014and two points on that. You go to Congress a lot and talk to members of Congress.  Now, Secretary\n\nSeptember 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll\u2019s Press Conference FINAL Paulson and Mr. Geithner and Chair Bernanke have said that Cong ress made a mistake when it took away the Fed\u2019s emergency powers in Dodd-Frank. And then o ne other thing is that, are you confident that all these  nonbanks didn\u2019t\u2014you know, nonbanks never got put into the, you know, the FSOC, you know, system.  So are you confident that the\u2014you can see the risks in the financial system?  Thank you. CHAIRMAN POWELL. So, three things there.  The first thing is the single biggest thing I think that we learned was th e\u2014as I mentioned, I think, earlie r, the importance of maintaining the stability of the financial system.  So I think if you look\u2014 if you look back at the way the models worked and the way people thought about risk in the econ omy, that\u2019s what was missing, and I think it\u2019s not missing anymore.  So we\u2014you know, we put a tremendous focus on that. We raised capital, liquidity. We  have stress tests, which force banks to understand\u2014the largest banks particularly\u2014to understand and better manage their risk and have enough capital to survive a really substantial shock that\u2019s at least as bad as th e financial crisis.  And if all that doesn\u2019t work, we\u2019ve got resolution plans, which we\u2019ve, you know , through many cycles, have made really substantial progre ss, more than I had thought was l ikely.  So we\u2019ve done a lot. Nobody\u2019s\u2014you know, nobody is, I think, overc onfident that we\u2019ve solved every problem.  And, you know, now we\u2019re going back and kind of taking a hard look a t everything and, you know, trying to make\u2014trying to\u2014t rying to keep at it. So I think those are the rea lly important lessons, and, you know, we\u2014we\u2019re determined not to, you know, not to forget them .  And that\u2019s, I think, a r isk now\u2014is to\u2014is to forget things that we\u2014that we learned. That\u2019 s just human nature over time. I saw the article you\u2019re talking about; the question is, did Congress take things away, emergency powers from the Fed?  S o there was sort of a trade for taking away our power under\n\nSeptember 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll\u2019s Press Conference FINAL 13, section 13(3), to provide s upport to individual nonbanks, w hich is really holding companies and other companies. In exchange for that, we got orderly liqu idation authority and a resolution authority. Was it a mistake?  I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any sense that Congress would seriously look at changing that. I have real  doubts about whether it was wise  to take away our crisis-fighting tools. I think you put them away, and you hope you never need them, but\u2014and I certainly strongly oppose efforts to tak e away more of our tools. You know, the third thing you ment ioned is the designation powe r.  So it\u2019s a really important power.  In my mind, it should be used\u2014my thinking, it  should be used sparingly, and that means, you know, in situations where you have\u2014I mean, in principle, you could have another Lehman Brothers come up out of the ground that\u2019s not a bank, and it could be very threatening\u2014or it could be capab le of creating systemic risk.  And so I think it\u2019s a critical power to have. But, again, I would use it\u2014I would tend to use it fairly sparingly. NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER .  Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.  Are you worried about the effect of risi ng interest rates on consumers? Credit card rates have jumped to more than 17 percent since the Fe d started raising interest rat es.  Mortgage rates are up. What do you say to consumers? CHAIRMAN POWELL. Yeah, we look\u2014of  course, we look at that very  carefully, and interest rates are going up acro ss a broad range of consumer bo rrowing, as they would when we raise short-term interest ra tes.  They\u2019re still quite low by hi storical levels.  And the other thing I\u2019ll say is, take\u2014if you take  housing, if you look at the NAR A ffordability Index, housing is still more affordable now than it was be fore the financial crisis.  S o you\u2019re right that the cost of borrowing is going up, but it\u2019s going up from what were extraor dinarily low levels, and it is\n\nSeptember 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll\u2019s Press Conference FINAL something that we watch carefully.  You know, the effect on consumer spending is a very important channel through whic h interest rates work, and so we do monitor the effects. HANNAH LANG. Hi , Hannah Lang, American Banker.  OCC\u2019s decision to go at CRA alone suggests that there\u2019s som e sort of disagreement among how  to proceed with a joint plan. What are the issues that are preventing a joint plan from developing, and how close are you to a possible joint plan? CHAIRMAN POWELL. Well, at th e Fed, we are, you know, deeply co mmitted to the mission of CRA, which is for banks  to provide credit and other banking services in the communities they serve.  And we  have also been of the view for some time that with the evolution of technology particular ly and changes\u2014changes in the  nature of banking, that it\u2019s an appropriate time\u2014it\u2019s past an a ppropriate time, but now it\u2019s ce rtainly an appropriate time to revisit the way we think about CRA.  But we don\u2019t want to lose that focus on community, and, you know, we definitely want to see that fundamental purpose of the law sustained.  Many of the issues that we had were reflect ed in the OCC\u2019s ANPR, and we\u2019re\u2014 we\u2019re hopeful that, over time, there will be a joint proposed r ulemaking with the OCC, the FDI C, and the Fed.  It\u2019s a process, and, you know, we\u2019re very much interested in continuing to push it forward. STEVE BECKNER. Steve Beckner, f reelance journalist filing for NPR.  Mr. Chairman, following up on the neutral rate  issue\u2014and you touched on this\u2014 but, you know, you and your colleagues slightly lifted the longer-run estimate, the neutral  funds rate estimate to 3 percent, but that\u2019s still, I believe, like 125 basis points below where it w as six years ago.  What are the odds that productivity, you know, investment, productivity, labor ma rket, other developments could further push up the longer-run estimate and possibly make the p rojected funds rate levels less restrictive than they now seem?\n\nSeptember 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll\u2019s Press Conference FINAL CHAIRMAN POWELL. So, in principle,  the\u2014these starred variables\u2014the long-run growth rate of the economy, the neutral ra te of interest, the n atural rate of unemployment\u2014don\u2019t move quickly. They move very gr adually.  They\u2019re  pinned down b y longer-run forces, like demographics.  In the case of the funds rate, it\u2019s more\u2014it\u2019s pr oductivity\u2014it\u2019s appetite for safe assets and demographics and other things, too.  So they move quite slowly through time. I think we all look at them\u2014those of us who file SEPs every quarter will look at that every quarter and not make a cha nge every quarter but, every no w and again, make a change. And you\u2019re right\u2014we actually\u2014t he median ticked up a tenth.  It\u2019 s a tenth we\u2019re talking about here, so\u2014but still, I think it\u2019 s a positive thing that people could be raising their estimates of the longer-run neutral rate and poten tially the longer-run growth r ate.  Who knows?  And maybe reducing their level of the natural rate of unemployment, which  has been the trend.  It\u2019s just that you change those estimates over time.  They\u2019re informed by inco ming data.  They don\u2019t change a lot, though, although they did\u2014it\u2019s interesting that  the neutra l rate changed quite sharply after the financial crisis in many di fferent models, and it\u2019s been slow to recover.  I don\u2019t expect a dramatic recovery there, but, you know, we\u2014we\u2019re so bad at fore casting productivity.  It\u2019s just very hard to know when productiv ity is going to arrive and in w hat quantity.  So I think we have to be humble about how little we re ally know about where these starred value variables either are or are going. PAUL KIERNAN. Hi, Chairman.  Paul  Kiernan from Dow Jones Newsw ires.  Thank you for taking the question. I\u2019d lik e to just kind of ask agai n\u2014you mentioned earlier that gradual\u2014a gradual pace of rate increases will make it easier to react.  But, specifically, what are you going to be looking to see, because you\u2019ve also mentioned, you know, that monetary policy operates with a lag, so any kind of specific signposts that may be we\u2019ve reached the end of the\n\nSeptember 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll\u2019s Press Conference FINAL tightening cycle or where we s hould stop?  Secondly, if you wor ry about the divergence between interest rates in the U.S. and internationally, especially at a  time when emerging markets are under pressure. Thanks. CHAIRMAN POWELL. Sure. So, you know , some of the things that we\u2019d be looking at to tell us whether we\u2019re getti ng close to supply-side limits wo uld be, first, does job growth slow down?  A slowing down in job grow th would be an indicator, you know.  An unexpectedly sharp increase in wages or infla tion could tell you that you\u2019re reach ing those points.  You know, if headline growth slowed down, that\u2019 s another one.  So all of those things would be worth taking into consideration. I think also, though, we\u2019ve seen s ometimes sharp tightening in financial conditions, as we saw at the beginning of 2016, can ha ve a substantial effect pre tty quickly on our economy if it\u2019s a broad and significant tight ening.  So we would be looking for  those kinds of things and many other things. So, in terms of divergence, yes.  So the U.S. economy is, as I mentioned, is strong and is at a pretty positive moment, you know, with strong growth, heal thy labor market, inflation right on target, as I mentioned.  So\u2014a nd we\u2019ve seen growth abroad, bu t growth, I think, both in advanced economies and in some emerging economies has slowed do wn a little bit.  And in that world, you know, if the U.S. is stro nger, then that\u2019s just part  of the context, part of the environment that could mean a  higher dollar.  It could be\u2014it co uld therefore mean that some of our demand will wind up being shared with other economies.  That\u2019s the way the integrated international economy works.  So you could see that, and, you k now, it\u2019s just\u2014it\u2019 s just all of the\u2014all things tha t go into thinking about, you know, the path of the economy.\n\nSeptember 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll\u2019s Press Conference FINAL I would say, you know, we\u2019re not res ponsible for the dollar.  O f course, the Treasury is responsible for managing the dol lar, but the dollar has only partly recovered the decline that it had in 2017. It\u2019s moved up off its lows, but it\u2019s not as high as it was at the beginning of last year yet by a significant margin. JEAN YUNG. Hi. Jean Yung with Mar ket News International.  Can  you give us an update on the technical adjustment in implementing monetary pol icy that the Fed made earlier this year when it decoupled the i nterest on excess reserves rat e from the upper bound of the target range?  And have you bee n happy with that adjustment?  A nd do you see the need to make another such adjustment in the near future? CHAIRMAN POWELL. So we\u2019ve said that we would use our tools to assure that the federal funds rate trains\u2014trade s within the target range.  And the principal tools we use have been interest on excess reserv es and then, at the bottom end, a reverse repo facility.  So we\u2014in June, when we raised rates, we only raised the interest on exce ss reserves by 20 basis points and raised the range by 25, and that move d federal funds sort of back into the range.  It worked, and it was successful. The federal  funds rate traded in the low 19 0s, well within the range. We may\u2014we may do that again.  You know , we\u2014again, we have our tools, and we will use them. We think it\u2019s principally a f unction just of a number of things , but particularly high Treasury supply, and\u2014which is showing up in repo rates and then showing up in fed funds as well.  So we don\u2019t see it as a\u2014as a big problem.  We see it as a problem we can address with our tools, and we\u2019ll use them if we have to. COURTENAY BROWN. Hi, Chairman.  C ourtenay Brown from Axios.  L ast month, the CEA outlined a different way to calculate wage growth.  Has  the Fed looked at th at at all, and what are you seeing in terms of non wage-based compensation?\n\nSeptember 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll\u2019s Press Conference FINAL CHAIRMAN POWELL. So I wouldn\u2019t co mment on a CEA paper, and I would imagine they probably wouldn\u2019t comment on our stuff, either, but I woul d just say this.  So I am familiar with the question and the work. You know, we look\u2014we look at a  range of indicators of wages, and I think the broader, the better.  You really\u2014in a perfect\u2014a perfect wage measure would also include benefits, because a lot of compensation these days shows up in the form of benefits rather than wages, so I think it\u2019 s right to choose those broade r ones. But they\u2019re kind of all telling the same story right now.  If y ou look at the principal four that we look at\u2014we look at a w hole range of wage and benefit co st indicators\u2014they are all now showing wages and benefits around 3 percent growth, right?  Clu stered around 3 percent.  That\u2019s a full percentage point higher th an it was five years ago.  Tha t\u2019s a good thing.  Then the question\u2014the other question is , what about inflation?  You know , if you\u2019re\u2014if you\u2019re looking for real wage increases, you\u2019 ve got to ask inflation, and there , you have to pick an inflation measure.  Some people pick CPI .  We, of course, pick personal consumption expenditures because we think it\u2019s a little better measure.  It\u2019s a little b roader, and it tends to run a little bit lower as well, but that\u2019s not w hy we pick it.  We just think it\u2019s more accurate.  And that\u2014the trend there is running around 2 perc ent, so if wages are runnin g at rough\u2014wages and benefits running at roughly 3 percent and in flation running at around 2 percent.  PCE headline inflation is at 2.3 percent. PCE core is at a bout 2, and I think we see tha t, you know, the temporary increase in headline inflation as bei ng a function of oil prices probabl y, and we expect inflation to go back down to 2 percent. So we think of t hat as 2 percent.  That\u2019s how we think about it.  Is that\u2014I hope that helps. MYLES UDLAND. Myles Udland, Yahoo F inance.  Chair Powell, I wa nt to follow up on something you said, actually, at Ja ckson Hole.  You were talking about longer-te rm structural\n\nSeptember 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll\u2019s Press Conference FINAL challenges for the economy, and you mentioned that addressing the federal budget deficit, which has long been on an unsustainable path, becomes increasingly important as a larger share of the population retires. I\u2019m just wondering if you could, you know,  maybe expand on your thoughts there and if this is an issue th at comes up among members of th e FOMC at all. CHAIRMAN POWELL. So it doesn\u2019t really come up.  It\u2019s not reall y our job.  And we do\u2014we do monetary policy. We regulate financial institutions, financial stability, that sort of thing. We don\u2019t have responsibil ity for fiscal policy.  But in the longer-run, fiscal policy will have a significant effect on the economy, so for that reason, I think my predecessors have commented on fiscal policy. But the y\u2019ve commented on\u2014at a high  level rather than trying to get involved in particular , you know, particular measures.  And  so\u2014and I\u2014my plan is to kind of stick to the same appro ach and stay in our lane. And, you know\u2014so I would just say, it\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s no secret, it\u2019s been true for a long time that with our uniquely expensive he alth-care delivery system and the aging of our population, we\u2019ve been on an unsustainable fiscal path for a long time, and  there\u2019s no hiding from it.  In the end, we will have to face that, and I think, you know, the sooner, the better.  And also, these are good times.  These are, you know, this is\u2014this is the economy a t nearly full employment or in the range\u2014in the neighborhood of f ull employment.  Interest rat es are low.  It\u2019s a\u2014it\u2019s a good time to be addressing these thi ngs.  So I just\u2014I put that out there and leave it at that. TAKESHI KAWANAMI. I\u2019m Takeshi Kawanami from Nikkei newspaper. Thank you for taking my question. I\u2019d like to ask about emerging markets.  What do you think about impact of U.S. monetary policy on emergi ng markets\u2014interest rate, curr ency depreciation, or capital outflow from emerging countri es?  And do you think there is a p ossibility to stop t he interest rate hike due to emerging markets turmoil\u2014due to turmoil in emerging  markets?\n\nSeptember 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll\u2019s Press Conference FINAL CHAIRMAN POWELL. Sorr y, the second question was? TAKESHI KAWANAMI. There is a possibility to stop the . . . CHAIRMAN POWELL. Oh, to stop. TAKESHI KAWANAMI. . . . hike. CHAIRMAN POWELL. Well, we serve a domestic mandate, which is a ssigned to us by Congress, and that is to have max imum employment and stable pri ces.  About half of global GDP is outside the United States,  and way more than half of the  growth is outside the United States and in emerging markets,  I should say.  And so the perfo rmance in the emerging market economies really, really matte rs to us in carrying out our dome stic mandate.  I\u2019d also say that, you know, a strong U.S. economy, where Americans are buying thi ngs and the economy is growing and our\u2014you know, that\u2019s going to support demand all around the globe, so that\u2019s a good thing. Now, we do understand, though, that when we\u2014when our economy is  strong and we\u2019re raising rates, that puts upward pressure on interest rates arou nd the world and can affect countries, particularly countries  that have significant externa l dollar borrowing.  And what we try to do is be very transparent a bout what we\u2019re doing and why.  A nd we have been, I believe, and we\u2019ve also moved quite gradually.  So I\u2014you know, I think we\u2019ve been performing well on that front. There are some countries that are\u2014that are undergoing severe stress, a handful of them, and\u2014but not most emerging market countries.  It\u2019s a relatively small number, and those particular countries have,  you know, have particular vulnerabil ities, which are w ell known in the form of budget deficits, and significant external dollar borrow ings, and high inflation, and things like that. So, again, we\u2019ll cont inue to conduct U.S. monetary policy as transparently as we\n\nSeptember 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll\u2019s Press Conference FINAL possibly can, and that\u2019s really  the best thing we can do, along with supporting U.S. growth.  I\u2019ll just\u2014I think that answers both your questions, actually. VIRGINIE MONTET. Virginie Montet with Agence France-Presse.  Y ou mentioned earlier a possible, not probable , correction, and I want to com e back to the high level of the stock market.  Are there any participants to the FOMC to think that w e are witnessing an episode of irrational exuberance or rationa l exuberance?  And if there was a steep correction, would it provoke financial stability concerns? CHAIRMAN POWELL. So I don\u2019t comme nt on the appropriateness of the level of stock prices. I can say that by some valuation measures, they\u2019re in the upper range of their historical value ranges. But, you know, I wouldn\u2019 t want to\u2014I wouldn\u2019t want to speculate about what the consequences of a market corr ection should be.  You know, we would\u2014we would look very carefully at the nature of it, a nd I mean, it\u2014really\u2014really what hurts is if consumers are borrowing heavily and doing so against, for example, an asset that can fall in value.  So that\u2019s a really serious matter when you have a housing bubble and highly  levered consumers and housing values fall. And we know that that\u2019s a really bad situation.  A simple drop in equity prices is\u2014 all by itself, doesn\u2019t really have those features.  It could certainly feature\u2014it could certainly affect consumption and have a ne gative effect on the economy, though. MARK HAMRICK. Thank you, Mr. Chair man.  Mark Hamrick with Bank rate.com . One thing that\u2019s changed since the crisis is, the majority of m ortgages issued last year came from so-called nonbank lenders, as trad itional banks scaled back.  W hat confidence do you have about supervision and, I suppose, also regulation in this space given  the role of housing finance in the crisis?  Thank you.\n\nSeptember 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll\u2019s Press Conference FINAL CHAIRMAN POWELL. It\u2019s a good que stion.  So you\u2019re right that a  lot of mortgages are now originated outside the s ystem.  Many of those, though, have  to meet certain basic standards to be bought by the GSEs. I think we\u2014if we look at mortgage cr edit more broadly, though, what we see is that credit is pretty widely available to people with  high scores and with good credit\u2014 good credit records, and much, much  less available than it was before the crisis to people with low scores and perhaps troubled credit history. You know, it\u2019s \u2014have we\u2014have we set\u2014have we got that exactly right?  I  don\u2019t know.  I mean, I\u2014but that\u2019s  clearly\u2014that\u2019s the reality.  In terms of those institutions, t hey do have supervision by the CF PB and other state regulators.  But you\u2019re right. They\u2019re much\u2014much of the origination process has  moved outside the banking system, and it\u2019s something we monitor."

    "text": "December 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll\u2019s Press Conference FINAL Transcript of Chairman Powell\u2019s Press Conference December 19, 2018 CHAIRMAN POWELL. Good afternoon, e veryone.  Thanks very much for being here today. [Cough] Pardon me. Over the past year the economy ha s been growing at a strong pac e, the unemployment rate has been near record lows , and inflation has been low and stable.  All of those things remain true today. Since the Septembe r meeting of the FOMC, however, some crosscurrents have emerged.  I\u2019ll explain how my co lleagues and I are incorporatin g those crosscurrents into our judgments about the outlook and t he appropriate course of polic y. Since September, the U.S. econom y has continued to perform well , roughly in line with our expectations. The economy ha s been adding jobs at a pace t hat will continue bringing the unemployment rate down over time.  Wages have moved up for work ers across a wide range of occupations\u2014a welcome developmen t.  Inflation has remained low and stable and is ending the year a bit more subdued than most had expected.  Although some American families and communities continue to struggle and some longer-term economic problems remain, the strong economy is benefiting many Americans. Despite this robust economic  backdrop and our expectation for h ealthy growth, we have seen developments that may signa l some softening relative to wh at we were expecting a few months ago. Growth in other econo mies around the world has mod erated somewhat over the course of 2018, albeit to still-solid  levels.  At the same time , financial market volatility has increased over the past couple of  months, and overall financial  conditions have tightened\u2014that is, they have become le ss supportive of growth. In our view, these developments  have not fundamentally altered the outlook.  Most\n\nDecember 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll\u2019s Press Conference FINAL year. The projections of Committ ee participants released today  show growth continuing at healthy levels, the unemployment rate falling a bit further next year, and infla tion remaining near 2 percent. The projections also s how a modestly lower path for  the federal funds rate, which should support the economy and keep us near our goals.  As the economy struggled to recover from the financial crisis a nd the subsequent recession, the Com mittee held our policy rate near zero for seven years to give the economy the best chance to rec over.  And the economy did recover steadily, if slowly at times. Three years ago the Committee cam e to the view that the best wa y to achieve our mandate was to gradually move interest rates back to levels tha t are more normal in a healthy economy.  Today we raised our target range for the short-term i nterest rates by another \u00bc percentage point. As I\u2019ve mentio ned, most of my colleagues e xpect the economy to continue to perform well in the coming year .  Many FOMC participants had  expected that economic conditions would likely call for about three more rate increase s in 2019.  We have brought that down a bit and now think it is more likely that the economy wil l grow in a way that will call for two interest rate increases  over the course of next year. We always emphasize that our po licy decisions are not on a pres et course and will change if the incoming data materiall y change the outlook.  And, given  recent developments, the statement notes that we \u201cwill continue to monitor global economic and financial developments and assess their implications  for the economic outlook.\u201d Now I will provide some additiona l context and detail, starting with a review of policy over the last year.  Last December, the unemployment rate was 4 .1 percent, and inflation had been running just below 2 percen t.  FOMC participants and many other forecasters were predicting that grow th in 2018 would be strong.  This growth wa s predicted to push the\n\nDecember 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll\u2019s Press Conference FINAL unemployment rate down to near his toric lows, and the increasingly tight labor market was expected to help push i nflation up to 2 percent. Given this outlook, Committee members judged that the appropria te way to sustain the expansion with inflation near 2 pe rcent was to continue gradually withdrawing the extraordinary support for the economy that had been in place for almost 10 years.  Thus, in December 2017, the median of the projections of  FOMC participants pointed to t hree \u00bc point interest rate increases in 2018, which would have left the target range for the federal funds rate at year-end at 2 to 2\u00bc percent, still below most e stimates of the longer-run n ormal rate. Early in 2018, it became clear tha t the economy was likely to be even stronger than we had expected, in part because the  fiscal stimulus adopted near the start of the year was larger and more front-end loaded than most ha d anticipated.  The signs of a more robust economy proved accurate, and the FOMC has now rai sed rates four times this yea r, counting today\u2019s action, one more time than anticipated in the median projection a year ago. This illustrates the nature of data dependence that we always e mphasize.  In 2018, the economy was somewhat more robust than expected, and this led to  a slightly faster pace of policy normalization than had been projected.  When the economy  has, instead, turned out weaker than expected, the Comm ittee has slowed or paused the pa ce of rate increases as we did in 2016. And when the economy has performed about as expected,  the Committee has generally moved in line with the med ian projection as we did in 2017. What kind of year will 2019 be?  We know that the economy may n ot be as kind to our forecasts next year as it was this year.  History attests that unforeseen events as the year unfolds may buffet the economy and call fo r more than a slight change f rom the policy projections released today.\n\nDecember 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll\u2019s Press Conference FINAL With that caveat, there are tw o important differences in the po licy outlook today versus next year. In early 2018, we saw a rising trajectory for growth; today, instead, we see growth moderating ahead. FOMC participants, along with many other forecasters, had long predicted some moderation of growth in 2019.  T he additional tightening o f financial conditions we have seen over the past couple of mont hs along with signs of somewha t weaker growth abroad have also led us to mark down growth a nd inflation projections a bit.  The median of FOMC participants\u2019 projections show s growth of 3 percent this year a nd 2.3 percent in 2019.  With growth remaining next year above its longer-run normal value, the unemployment rate is projected to fall a bit furt her, to 3.5 percent by the end of 2 019.  Inflation in the median projection remains near 2 percent. Second, the economy has continued to strengthen this year.  And , given our four rate increases and the ongoing reduction in our portfolio, monetary policy will be providing a smaller boost to the economy in 2019.  After today\u2019s action, the target range for the feder al funds rate is 2\u00bc to 2\u00bd percent, putting it at the lower end of the range of e stimates of the longer-run normal rate provided by the Committee. Over the next year, if events pl ay out broadly as expected, the federal funds rate will be in a range in which judgments  of people both inside and outside  the Fed will sometimes differ regarding whether the stance of policy is modestly accommodativ e, neutral, or modestly restrictive. When rates are in this range, the FOMC makes poli cy in light of the array of diverse views on the Committee.  Moving forward, my colleagues and I will be watching the economy closely for indications that th e stance of policy is appropriate to sustain the expansion with a strong labor market and i nflation near 2 percent.\n\nDecember 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll\u2019s Press Conference FINAL It is worth noting that the Summ ary of Economic Projections is a compilation of the individual projections of all FO MC participants.  We sometimes point to the median of these projections to illustrate the broad middle of views of the Committee.  Each participant\u2019s projection represents appropr iate policy under the baseline out look\u2014baseline outlook provided by that participant. We believe t hat the SEP provides useful i nformation about Committee participants\u2019 thinking, but the me dian is not a consensus judgm ent and certainly does not represent a Committee plan.  Actual policy will, as always, be adjusted as incoming data shed light on the state of the ec onomy, the outlook, and the changin g balance of risks. Neither the pace nor the ultimate  destination of any further ra te increases is predetermined.  We will adjust monetary policy as best we can t o keep the expansion on track, the labor market strong, and inf lation near 2 percent.  We know  that our policy decisions affect all American families and businesses, and we\u2019ll continue to mak e our decisions objectively and based solely on the best inf ormation and analysis.  Thank you, and I\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. SAM FLEMING.  Thanks very much.  Sam Fleming from the Financial Times.  One of the recent surprises has been fairly tepid inflation data.  I w onder, first of all, if you could explain why you think, despite the extremely tight labor market, we\u2019re still not seeing much in the way of inflationary pressu res.  And in the context of a more data-d ependent Fed, how will the Fed respond to further undershoots of  inflation moving into next year?  Thanks. CHAIRMAN POWELL. Well, you\u2019re rig ht, Sam.  Inflation has come in just a touch below where we expected it to be\u2014not by a big amount, but by a small amount.  More broadly, 2018 has been the strongest year since the recov\u2014since the fina ncial crisis.  And during that period we\u2019ve had low unemployment and strong growth, and inflat ion has still remained just a\n\nDecember 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll\u2019s Press Conference FINAL touch below 2 percent.  So I do thi nk that gives the Committee the ability to be patient in moving forward. As I mentioned, there\u2019s  significant uncertainty about  the\u2014both the path and the ultimate destination of any further rate increases. HEATHER LONG.  Hi, Heather Long from the Washington Post.  Today, the Fed lowered its expectations for interest rate increases.  Given th at, I\u2019m wondering if the Fed has had any discussion of altering the cour se of balance sheet normaliz ation and if you could give us any insight on what might lead the F OMC to alter that balance sheet  normalization in 2019. CHAIRMAN POWELL. Sure. If you go b ack some years, I think we\u2014 people who were working at the Fed in 2013 and \u201914 t ook away the lesson that the markets could be very sensitive to news about the size of the balance sheet, the pace of asset purchases, the pace of runoff, and things like that. So we thought carefully about this, on how t o normalize policy, and came to the view that we would effectively have the balance sheet runoff on  automatic pilot and use monetary policy, rate policy, t o adjust to incoming data. And I think that has been a good decision.  I think that the ru noff of the balance sheet has been smooth and has served its purpose.  And I don\u2019t see us changing that.  And I do think that we will continue to use monetary policy, which is to say rate p olicy, as the active tool of monetary policy. NICK TIMIRAOS. Thanks. Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.   Chairman Powell, you talked a little bit ea rlier about the ability to be  patient.  And so as you think about your next policy moves, are you inclined to go at the current r ecent pace to a slightly different destination that\u2019s laid out i n the projections today?  Or does the current environment of restrained inflation maybe allow you to space out your next few  moves and take more time to get there?\n\nDecember 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll\u2019s Press Conference FINAL CHAIRMAN POWELL. So, as background, I would just point to 2018  being a very strong year and the Committee looking forward to 2019 and still  having what amounts to a positive forecast.  We still are forecasting, individually, gro wth a bit above its longer-run potential\u20142.3 percent is what we\u2019re forecasting.  We\u2019re forecas ting that growth will be strong enough that unemployment will drop  still further and inflation will remain right near our target. So I\u2019d say that\u2019s a reasonably positive forecast. Going forward, you know, I will be l ooking, in particular, to see whether incoming data tell us that we\u2019re, in fact, on tha t path, that development of the economy is in line with that expectation.  That will be the main thing.  More broadly, thoug h, I think we\u2019ve reached the bottom end of the range of Comm ittee estimates of what might be  neutral.  I think, from this point forward, we\u2019re going to be l etting the data speak to us a nd form the outlook and inform our understanding of what would be a ppropriate policy.  So there\u2019s a fairly high degree of uncertainty about both the path a nd the ultimate destination of  any further increases. STEVE LIESMAN. Mr. Chairman, Steve Liesman, CNBC.  Could you t ell us how three things affected the outlook for t he economy and rates?  The fir st is how the market\u2019s decline affected the outlook for the economy and for rates.  The second is trade tensions and the tariff, or how you factor that into your outlo ok.  And the third is commen ts by the President urging you not to hike rates. CHAIRMAN POWELL. So, as I menti oned, we monitor a broad range of economic conditions, including financial c onditions\u2014a broad range of financial conditions.  And we took on board the tightening in financial conditions, which\u2014not any one condition, but, broadly speaking, financial conditions have tightened since the September meeting, really.  So we took that on board in our forecast. Tha t\u2019s why the forecast for gro wth and inflation went down a little\n\nDecember 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll\u2019s Press Conference FINAL bit. But, remember, that\u2019s in a context of a more accommodativ e path.  So we also took down our rate forecast. So we defin itely did take that into account , and, as you can see from the statement language, we acknowledge d those risks in the clause a bout monitoring developments. And we\u2019re going to be watching car efully to see as those things develop. I think, more broadly, there\u2019s been a sense of concern among business people and market people about global growt h, and, you know, that may be partly about trade tensions, it may be partly about a variety of things .  If you just mechanically dro p into a model of the U.S. economy tariffs, you don\u2019t see very large effects.  The large effects w ould have to come from financial market changes or from losses in business confidence.  And those are things that are very difficult to model. On your third factor, you know, political considerations have played no role whatsoever in our discussions or decisions about monetary policy.  We\u2019re a lways going to be focused on the mission that Congress has given us .  We have the tools to carry  it about.  We have the independence, which we think i s essential t o be able to do our jobs in a nonpolitical way.  And you know, we are\u2014we at the Fed are absolutely committed to that mission, and nothing will deter us from doing what we t hink is the right thing to do. BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.  Binya Appelbaum, the New York Times.  You\u2019re about to undershoot your inflation target for the seventh straight year.  Your new forecasts say that you\u2019re going to undershoot it for the ei ghth straight year.  Should we  interpret the dot plot as suggesting that some members of your Comm ittee believe that policy should be in a restrictive range by the end of next year?  If so, can you help us to understand why peo ple would be advocating restrictive monetary policy at a time of persistent inflation u ndershoots?\n\nDecember 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll\u2019s Press Conference FINAL CHAIRMAN POWELL. Well, we\u2014as a Committee, we do not desire inf lation undershoots. And you\u2019re right, infl ation has continued to surp rise to the downside\u2014not by a lot, though. I think we\u2019re very clo se to 2 percent, and, you know, we do believe it\u2019s a symmetric goal for us. Inflation is symmetric around 2 percent, and that \u2019s how we\u2019re going to look at it. We\u2019re not trying to be under 2 perc ent.  We\u2019re trying to be sym metrically around 2 percent.  And I don\u2019t\u2014you know, I\u2019ve never said t hat I feel like we\u2019ve achiev ed that goal yet.  The only way to achieve inflation symmetricall y around 2 percent is to have inflation symmetrically around 2 percent, and we\u2019ve been close t o that but we haven\u2019t gotten t here yet, and we have not declared victory on that.  So that remains to be accomplished. JEANNA SMIALEK. Hi, Jeanna Smialek, Bloomberg News.  Just foll owing up on Binya\u2019s question\u2014I guess if you have n\u2019t achieved 2 percent infl ation and you don\u2019t see an overshoot, which would be sort of  implied by a symmetrical targ et, what\u2019s the point in raising rates again at all? CHAIRMAN POWELL. So, again, I go back to the health of the eco nomy.  If you look at 2018, as I mentioned, this the best year since the financial  crisis.  You\u2019ve had growth well above trend. You\u2019ve got unemploym ent dropping.  You\u2019ve got inflation moving up to 2 percent. And we also have a positive forecast, as I mentioned, and, in t hat context, we think this move was appropriate for what is a very healthy economy. Policy at this point does not need to be accommodative.  It can  move to neutral.  It seems appropriate that it be neutral. We\u2019re now at the bottom end of  the range of estimates of neutral. So that\u2019s the basis upon which w e made the decision.  I also th ink we took on board, you know, the risks to that, and, you know, w e\u2019re certainly cognizant of them.\n\nDecember 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll\u2019s Press Conference FINAL MARTIN CRUTSINGER. Mr. Chairma n, Marty Crutsinger with the AP.  You\u2019ve established for this coming year  a communicatio ns panel to look  at how the Fed communicates. Could you talk a little bit about  what you expect to get from t hat panel, and will the dot plot be involved in that at all? H ow do you think the dot plot is work ing?  Are we dealing with it the way that you want us to be handli ng the dot plot, or is it something that you mi ght tweak a bit? CHAIRMAN POWELL. So this review, w hat it really is\u2014it\u2019s coming  at a time when the economy is strong, and it\u2019s a goo d time to take a step back, we think, and ask whether our strategy and our tools and our communications around monetary p olicy are doing the job that Congress has assigned us to do on be half of the American people .  And what we\u2019re going to do is, we\u2019re going to open ourselves  up and have a discussion with many outside groups of all different parts of the economy, including, you know, an academi c conference in June in Chicago. And, again, the idea is to, you know, listen to new ideas, bett er ideas, old ideas\u2014many of them have been around\u2014and try to assess whether there are bette r ways we can do things.  One of the overarching facts is that rates have been really coming down overall for more than three decades now.  We may be in a worl d where interest rates are jus t lower for the time being, and, therefore, we\u2019ll have less policy space to react to economic do wnturns.  And we\u2019d want to be evaluating ideas for\u2014again, for be tter achieving the goals that  Congress has given us. We\u2019re not looking at law change s at all, and we\u2019re not looking at changing t he inflation target, for example.  We are look ing for better ways to achieve  the inflation goal\u2014for example, on a symmetric basis.  So that\u2019s the sense of that. As I mentioned, on the dot plot\u2014yo u asked about the dot plot.  I think the dot plot generally does provide useful in formation about the reaction fu nction of Committee participants\u2014sometimes more usef ul than others, I\u2019ll admit.  Bu t, in general, I think people sort\n\nDecember 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll\u2019s Press Conference FINAL of have it figured out and unders tand what it is  and what it is n\u2019t.  But that doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t like to repeat what it isn\u2019t, whi ch\u2014it\u2019s not a consensus foreca st.  It\u2019s not something that we vote on. It\u2019s something that each of  us writes down, and we always update it as\u2014you know, as data come in and as we update our outlooks. MICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee fr om Bloomberg Radio and Televisi on.  The balance sheet reduction\u2014how much additi onal tightening do you t hink has come from that?  We know in the markets that the co st of credit rising, commercial paper, repo rates, the TED spread widening\u2014do you see any concerns about the availability or the price of credit that could slow the markets?  And if, in 2019, we see the economy start to slow, would you, if you don\u2019t adjust the balance sheet, be risking too much tightening? CHAIRMAN POWELL. So we do watc h all of that, but the amount of \u2014the amount of runoff that we\u2019ve had so far is pretty small.  And if you just run the quantitative easing models in reverse, you would get a pretty small adjustment in economic growth and real outcomes.  So we don\u2019t think, you know, things that are happening at the short run\u2014at the short end\u2014are driven by many other factors other than  the balance sheet runoff.  For  example, just\u2014very large bill supply has pushed up short-term rates, has pushed up repo rates .  Tightening of the federal funds rate has raised short-term  borrowing costs.  So, you know, we\u2019r e alert to these issues.  We\u2019re watching them carefully.  But we don\u2019t see, you know, the balan ce sheet runoff as creating significant problems. EDWARD LAWRENCE. Hi, Edward Law rence, Fox Business Network.  T hank you, Mr. Chairman.  We\u2019ve seen enorm ous volatility in the markets re cently.  We know the President said, you know, don\u2019t raise interest rates.  It\u2019s well documented.  The National Association of Realtors\u2019 chief economist says t hat it\u2019s starti ng to affect fir st-time homebuyers with the mortgage\n\nDecember 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll\u2019s Press Conference FINAL rates going up. When do you think t hese pauses need to come in  next year?  Do we need to keep this, as you say, gradual?  And then, in addition, what data ar e you specifically looking at for you that shows when the Federal Reser ve starts to become that headw ind in the economy with the rates? CHAIRMAN POWELL. You know, we\u2019re w atching\u2014we have a strong forecast, generally, for next year. That  forecast involves growth, you k now, between 2 and 2\u00bd percent.  It involves growth at a strong enough level to continue driving un employment down and inflation near 2 percent. So that\u2019s a pretty positive forecast.  So, to make further moves, I\u2019ll be looking for data that suggests that tha t\u2019s, in fact, the path that we\u2019r e on. As I mentioned, once you\u2014once you\u2019re, broadly speaking, in the range of neutral, I think it\u2019s appropriate to be putting asi de individual estimates of that and be looking at what the incoming data are telling you about the outlook, updating your estimates of what neutral might be, of what the natural rate of unemployment might be, of the state of the economy, so\u2014and letting that lead you to adjust  your outlook and, therefore, yo ur appropriate path for policy.  So that\u2019s what we mean when we say w e\u2019re \u201cdata dependent.\u201d  Of cou rse, we\u2019re always data dependent, but I think it has a  particular meaning in this cont ext, which is that. VICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Mr. Chair man.  I wanted to ask, first of a ll, whether you\u2019re worried that President Trump\u2019s tweeting and statements might in terfere with your ability to communicate with markets and w hy you\u2019re doing what you\u2019re doing.  And then, also, I was wondering if you could comment on\u2014Governor Brainard gave a spee ch recently where she laid out the case for the countercyc lical capital buffer being activ ated.  Do you disagree with her analysis?  Is that something that you think the Fed should look at doing?\n\nDecember 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll\u2019s Press Conference FINAL CHAIRMAN POWELL. I\u2019m not worri ed, because\u2014about\u2014on the first q uestion\u2014 because I know, and everyone who works at the Fed knows, that w e\u2019re going to do our jobs the way we\u2019ve always done them.  And that involves, you know, I thi nk getting the best thinking together, diverse perspectives. We\u2014every business\u2014every FOMC c ycle, we talk to hundreds of people in all different parts of  society, not just business peo ple or market people, but people from community development organizatio ns.  We get survey data from thousands of people, and so we really do have a pretty broad e xposure to what\u2019s going on in all different parts of the country. And we\u2019re going to take all that  information, and we\u2019re going to make the best decisions we can, and nothing will cause us to deviate from that. In terms of the CCyB, so the CCyB is\u2014the countercyclical capita l buffer is a tool that allows us to build capital at a t ime when vulnerabilities\u2014finan cial stability vulnerabilities\u2014are meaningfully above normal.  And so that\u2019s a tool I\u2019d be absolut ely willing to use and happy to use at such time as that test is met.  We meet and discuss that  and evaluate it on roughly an annual basis. We haven\u2019t done i t since early this year.  I think we\u2019ll be doing it early next year, and we\u2019ll be reaching that judgment then.  I will tell you, I r ecently gave a sp eech saying that I believe that financial stabili ty vulnerabilities were roughly a t a moderate level.  So, for me, that\u2014but I would want to leav e open\u2014my mind open on that and ha ve that discussion with my Board colleagues when the issue arises. ANN SAPHIR.  Ann Saphir with Reuters.  You said that policy doe s not need, at this point, to be accommodative.  But does it need to be restrictive , as the dots seem to suggest that it will be? CHAIRMAN POWELL. Does it current ly need to be restrictive?  No .  And I don\u2019t believe that it is. I  don\u2019t believe that po licy is restrictive .\n\nDecember 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll\u2019s Press Conference FINAL ANN SAPHIR. Next year. The dots suggest it will be restrictiv e next year.  Should it be? CHAIRMAN POWELL. Yeah, I\u2014I\u2019ve di scussed this a couple of times .  It\u2019s a very good question. And I guess I would just go back to this:  The indiv idual forecasts are not something that the Committee votes on. They\u2019re out in the future.  We vote on the rate increase, and we write down our\u2014you know, our own personal paths. So people hav e disparate views on what the endpoint could be. Ultimately, it\u2019s going to depend on what the circumstances are.  There would be circumstances in which it w ould be appropriate to go past neutral, and there would be circumstances in which it woul d be wholly inappropriate to do s o.  So I don\u2019t\u2014I wouldn\u2019t put too much on\u2014it does inform you, the  way people are thinking about things.  But don\u2019t\u2014I wouldn\u2019t take it as a signal about current policy or about near -term policy. PAUL KIERNAN. Hi, Paul Kiernan f rom Dow Jones Newswires.  Than ks for the question. In Dallas last mont h you talked about the usefulness of speaking with businesses, sometimes hearing things that aren\u2019t yet showing up in the econ omic data.  And I was just wondering if you\u2019re hearing anythin g from businesses that might  explain the recent market moves. You know, are markets on to something that, again, hasn \u2019t showed up yet in the data? Thanks. CHAIRMAN POWELL. So, if  you look at the Tealbook, or\u2014you know,  we get the Tealbook in person from the Rese rve Bank presidents who come in, and they share their discussions not just with their directors, but with literally h undreds of business and nonprofit, you know, and labor union people around the country.1 And I personally find it really\n\nDecember 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll\u2019s Press Conference FINAL interesting. My background is ve ry much working\u2014starting with,  you know, a small group of people, maybe a company, and w orking out.  So that kind of anecdotal data really helps me capture the picture better. So\u2014and, you know, what\u2014what you\u2019re  picking up now, I think, is,  there\u2019s, you know, a mood of concern, or it\u2019s a mood of angst about growth going for ward, if I could just capture it in one thought. There are many reasons  that are given for that, b ut, generally speaking, it\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s a concern about, is growth going to be  as strong as it was?  Why not?  What might it be\u2014to different people?  But that mood i s out there.  That doesn\u2019t me an that it\u2019ll come i nto the real data in a big way\u2014it may, but\u2014or that fi nancial conditions will tighten further.  We\u2019ll just have to see. For now, financial conditions  have tightened a little bit .  We\u2019ve taken t hat on board both in the outcomes, in our forecast, but also in a lower rate path to \u2014you know, to provide some accommodation to push back against that tightening.  That\u2019s how  I think about it. GREG ROBB. Greg Robb from MarketWatch.  Just following up on P aul\u2019s question\u2014 President Trump said recently that you should feel the markets.   So when you see the markets, you know, what are the markets telling you? CHAIRMAN POWELL. You know, financial conditions\u2014broadly speaki ng, we don\u2019t look at any one market.  We look at a really big range of finan cial conditions.  And what matters for the broader economy is material changes in a broad range of  financial conditions that are sustained for a period of time .  A little bit of volatility\u2014spe aking in the abstract\u2014some volatility doesn\u2019t probably leave a mar k on the economy.  So we look for that. And, you know, what we\u2019ve seen here is a tighten ing.  There\u2019s been a tightening since right around after\u2014a week or so a fter the September meeting.  A nd, you know, that\u2014we tried to factor that into our models of t he economy and to the results t hat come out of those models.\n\nDecember 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll\u2019s Press Conference FINAL That\u2019s how we think about it. So we do, you know\u2014we follow mar kets really carefully.  But, remember, from a macroeconomic standpoint, no one market is the  single dominant indicator and it really matters if changes are sustained over time. NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER .  Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.  Do you still think core PCE is a good m easure of whether the economy i s overheating?  What do you think of other measures like setting a target for economic grow th and relying more on that? CHAIRMAN POWELL. Well, I think we look at both, but core PCE is a good indicator. It has\u2014what\u2019s happened over, rea lly, 50 years is that inflation has become much less reactive to changes in growth. There was a  time when inflation reacted rea lly quickly to changes in growth and changes in unemployment, and that time is behind us.  And t hat is often attributed to the success of central banks in anchorin g inflation expectations so  that people believe that inflation will come back to the target or a round the target so it doesn\u2019t  go down as much\u2014inflation doesn\u2019t go down as much in a  downturn and doesn\u2019t go up as much  when the\u2014you know, when the economy is strong. It\u2019s really true, though, that infl ation has not reacted a lot on a road from 10 percent unemployment to now 3.7 percent unemployment.  Now, it did move  up last year.  But in terms of just targeting growth, you know , I think\u2014I actually think ou r dual mandate works very well, which is maximum employment and s table prices.  Most of the tim e, those two things work together. When they work temporar ily in different ways, we tak e a balanced approach.  But I think that approach has served us well, and I think we can work well with it. DONNA BORAK. Chairman Powell, D onna Borak with CNN.  Next year, every meeting will be a live meeting.  S o, presumably, there will be some adjustment in how the market anticipates when a rate  hike is coming.  How has the Com mittee thought through\n\nDecember 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll\u2019s Press Conference FINAL communicating those potential policy moves, especially in light  of the fact of the tremendous amount of uncertainty g oing into next year? CHAIRMAN POWELL. I think having regular press conferences will  be a big gain for communication. I certainly hope it will.  That\u2019s the plan.  An d so, being able to come out after each meeting and explain the Committee\u2019s thinking and relate th at to the state of the economy and expectations for policy and global developments, I think it \u2019ll be\u2014the idea is that it\u2019ll be helpful in explaining how we \u2019re thinking and, you know, explain ing what we\u2019re thinking about policy going forward. So that\u2019s the plan.  I do believe it wil l be a positive development. I think it\u2019ll also become the case, over time, that there will be no \u201cprior\u201d as to whether we would move at a quarterly mee ting or one of the meetings at which we do not file an SEP.  As you know, we only update our projecti ons under the current appr oach quarterly, whereas we have eight\u2014eight meetings.  So I think we\u2019ll move to a more\u2014we\u2019 ll have the ability to move eight\u2014at eight different meetings .  Not eight times, but at eig ht different meetings on the year. DONNA BORAK. I guess that\u2019s sort  of the question that I\u2019m tryi ng to drive at is, in terms of communicating to the market, because we\u2019ve been\u2014the ma rket\u2019s been so adjusted to the fact that these are quar ter-end rate hikes, and now you hav e the potential to move eight times a year\u2014is the Fed thinking thr ough how it\u2019s going to communicat e when it plans, especially given the amount of uncertainty? CHAIRMAN POWELL. Yes. I mean, I  think that\u2019s probably pretty straightforward.  If we, you know\u2014if we\u2019re\u2014if we want to communicate something about something that\u2019s going to happen in a future meeting, I  think we know how to do that in speeches, in press conferences, and such.\n\nDecember 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll\u2019s Press Conference FINAL DON LEE.  Don Lee with the L.A. Times.   You mentioned broad-bas ed wage gains this year, and I\u2019m wondering if you see further acceleration in wage  growth and just how much slack there is in the labor market. CHAIRMAN POWELL. So what we\u2019ve se en is, is a very gradual\u2014and, I think, ongoing\u2014increase in wages. If  you go back a few years, you\u2019ll see that we look at many, many indicators of wages and compens ation.  But there are four princ ipal ones.  And they were all kind of clustered around 2\u2014if you go back five years ago\u20142 percent i ncrease per year.  Now they are all at 3, and they\u2019ve just con tinued to gradually move up\u2014not p erfectly in sync, but\u2014and that\u2019s a number that is, you know, right  in keeping with 2 percent inf lation and 1 percent productivity growth. So in an economic sense, it makes sense. I do expect, and I think many forecasters expect, that wage inc reases will continue, and that would be a welcome development.  Wage\u2014wage increases do no t need to be inflationary. There\u2019s plenty of evidence of situations\u2014for example, in the very tight labor market of the late 1990s of a\u2014I think I mentioned in a speech a month or so ago, w e had wage increases above productivity plus inflation, and w e didn\u2019t have high inflation.  So it would be welcome.  We hear a great deal of anecdotal infor mation about labor shortages, al ong with other, you know, bottlenecks and things. So I woul d expect that wages will keep  moving up, and it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean inflation.  We  don\u2019t think of it that way.  So  did that answer your question? DON LEE.  Labor slack? CHAIRMAN POWELL. Labor s lack.  Yes. So, you know, by most ind icators\u2014we look at a very wide range of indicator s on the labor market.  And, b y most indicators, we are at or even above longer-run normal levels.  But I would point to one particular pocket, and that is, labor force participation by younger prime-age workers, particu larly prime-age males, is still,\n\nDecember 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll\u2019s Press Conference FINAL you know, meaningfully below its pre-crisis level.  Most other age groups in both genders have moved back up pretty close to where  they were at the last cycli cal peak.  You know, there\u2019s a question, can we go above that cy clical peak?  And\u2014or, or are the problems more structural than cyclical, and that there isn\u2019t\u2014 so we\u2019ll have to find that out.  I think, given the strong economy, we\u2019ve had the luxury of finding out  that labor force participat ion can be higher than we had thought. And that\u2019s not hing but a good thing. JOHN HELTMAN.  Hi, John Heltman with American Banker.  A regulatory question, if I may.  So, many of the Fed\u2019s regul atory proposals so far, especi ally this year, have been primarily focused on banks in the sort of medium-to-small range.  That is , a sort of tailoring enhanced prudential standards, particular ly for those banks, and I\u2019m thi nking of the stress capital buffer as well as the most recent proposal on banks between $100 and $250 billion. G-SIBs and the largest banks s eem to be sort of left out in a l ot of these proposals, and I\u2019m wondering if that is meant to s end a message that the Fed d oes not really intend to change its regulatory structure for the largest banks going forward, or if  you\u2019ll get to that maybe later.  And I\u2019m thinking specifically of the G-SIB capital surcharge, which  several members of Congress have sent letters to you asking you t o revisit and reconsider. CHAIRMAN POWELL. So you\u2019re right that a big focus of what we have been doing has been tailoring regulations.  And the sense of \u201ctailoring\u201d is that we want to look below the level of the G-SIBs at the l arge regionals and then on down to the community banks at various steps and ask whether we have appr opriately tailor ed regulation  and supervision to account for the fact that smaller and less complex organizations present a much less significant threat to the economy and to the community shou ld they fail\u2014should they exper ience material difficulty.  So, in the nature of that, you\u2019re foc used more on the smaller insti tutions.\n\nDecember 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll\u2019s Press Conference FINAL I think, with the larger institutions, we want regulation and s upervision to be effective and efficient. I know that the larger institutions tend to be the ones who care about the Volcker rule. That\u2019s something we \u2019re working on.  You know, we\u2014we think that things need to be looked at carefully. And, again, I  wouldn\u2019t want to materially  change capital levels, because, I think, you know, it\u2019s important that the largest financial inst itutions, the largest and most complex\u2014the systemically important ones be held to the highest standards and higher expectations. And while we may tai lor some regulations, those fundamentally high expectations are not going to change. STEVEN BECKNER. Steve Beckner, f reelance financial journalist reporting for NPR, Chairman Powell.  I know you look at many different financial i ndicators, but let me focus your attention briefly on bond yields. T he 10-year note yield has g one down pretty steeply, roughly 50 basis points, I think, in recent weeks.  I wonder what you m ake of it.  Is it a worrisome sign for you in terms of the outlook for  growth, for inflation?  On the other hand, could it be a positive, in terms of presumably bringing down mortgage rates a nd helping the housing sector? CHAIRMAN POWELL. Again, we do focus on a broad range of financ ial indicators, and I\u2014really, we don\u2019t obsess about any particular one.  You kn ow, we look at a whole range of them, and we ask ourselves, what\u2019 s really going on in the broad  picture out there?  You know, if you ask what\u2019s going on with the l ong\u2014certainly the long, longer-maturity Treasury market has come in some.  That\u2019s consis tent with, you know, a risk-off fee ling in the stock market as well. And, you know, we don\u2019t know whether t hat\u2019ll persis t.  Really, the longer Treasury has moved in a range above 3 percent and down 3 pe rcent as the risk sentimen t has changed.  You know, I think if rates were to stay low for a longer period of time, that could be thought of as a signal of expectations of lower grow th.  But, you know, we don\u2019t know tha t that\u2019ll happen.  As I\n\nDecember 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll\u2019s Press Conference FINAL mentioned, our forecast for next year is\u2014I think, in keeping with most other forecasts\u2014is that we\u2019ll still have solid growth ne xt year, declining unemployment , and a healthy economy. COURTENAY BROWN. Hi, Chairman, C ourtenay Brown from Axios.  I\u2019 m wondering if you could clear up what\u2019s become  a little bit of a debate in  the financial community.  You said in October in an interview with P BS that interest rates were a long way from neutral.  A month later you said interest rates we re just below neutral.  And I t hink a lot of people interpreted that as a shift in tone from you.  Were  they right to interpret it t hat way? CHAIRMAN POWELL. You know, monetar y policy is a forward-lookin g exercise, and I\u2019m going to\u2014I\u2019m just going to stick  with that.  It\u2019s\u2014where we are right now is, we\u2019re at the lower end of the range of neutra l.  We\u2019ve arrived effectively a t the bottom end of that range. And, you know, there are implications of that.  For that, as I mentioned, going forward, there\u2019s real uncertainty about the path\u2014t he pace, rather, and the desti nation for further rate increases. And we\u2019re going to be letting inco ming data inform our thinking about the appropriate path. MICHELLE FLEURY.  Michelle Fleury, BBC News. Chairman Powell, you talked about monitoring global developm ents.  I was wondering, you touched on trade, the trade dispute with China. But could you elabor ate on what economic developme nts you\u2019re referring to, whether Brexit is one of those?  What else? CHAIRMAN POWELL. More broadly, I\u2019m referring to global growth.   So, if you go back a year, 2017 was a year of  kind of ongoing upside surprise s in global growth.  It was the year of synchronized global growth.  And people raised their fo recasts for growth around the world kind of throughout 2017 and, in some sense, expected that  to continue into 2018.  What has happened instead has been a  modest retracing of that.  So you have still healthy levels of growth in the aggregate around the  world but close to the potential growth rate of, you know, the\n\nDecember 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll\u2019s Press Conference FINAL global economy.  But you no longer ha ve the really strong level s of growth you had in 2017.  So that is one\u2014that\u2019s, I think, the key fact. We also monitor, you know, event risks like Brexit\u2014like, you kn ow, like the negotiations between Italy and t he EU over their budget.  And, you know, as far as those are concerned, we monitor them very carefully.  And I\u2019m going to\u2014I\u2019 ll mention Brexit.  Our financial institutions have had a long time now to get ready fo r the full range of possible exits from the EU by the U.K.  And the y\u2019ve had supervisory involvemen t from U.S. supervisors, from U.K. supervisors, from EU supervisors\u2014we think they are fully p repared for the full range of outcomes that may come out of t hat.  I was very happy to see th e developments around central counterparties today. That was a big issue that seems to have been satisfactorily, for the time being, resolved. So it\u2019s somethi ng we\u2019re watchi ng carefully.  Honestly, it shouldn\u2019t have major implications for the United S tates, but, you know, there\u2019s a lo t of uncertainty because it\u2019s not something that\u2019s happened befo re.  So we\u2019ll be watching it carefully.  Thanks very much."

I will start with a recap of our discussions, including our assessment of the outlook for the economy and the judgments we made about our interest rate policy and our balance sheet.

My colleagues and I have one overarching goal:  to sustain the economic expansion, with a strong job market and stable prices, for the benefit of the American people.  The U.S. economy is in a good place, and we will continue to use our monetary policy tools to help keep it there. The jobs picture continues to be strong, with the unemployment rate near historic lows and with stronger wage gains.  Inflation remains near our 2 percent goal.  We continue to expect that the American economy will grow at a solid pace in 2019, although likely slower than the very strong pace of 2018.  We believe that our current policy stance is appropriate at this time. Despite this positive outlook, over the  past few months we have seen some crosscurrents and conflicting signals about the outlook.  Growth has slowed in some major foreign economies, particularly in China and Europe.  There is elevated uncertainty around several unresolved government policy iss ues, including Brexit, ongoing trade negotiations, and the effects from the partial government shutdown in the United States.  Financial conditions tightened considerably late in 2018 and remain less supportive of growth than they were earlier in 2018.

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome.   I will begin with an overview of economic conditions and an explanation of the decisions the Committee made at today\u2019s meeting. My colleagues and I have one overarching goal:  to sustain the economic expansion, with a strong job market and stable prices, for the benefit of the American people.  The U.S. economy is in a good place, and we will continue to use our monetary policy tools to help keep it there. The jobs market is strong, showing healthier wage gains and prompting many people to join or remain in the workforce.  The unemployment rate is near historic low s, and inflation remains near our 2 percent goal.  We continue to expect that the American economy will grow at a solid pace in 2019, although likely slower than the very strong pace of 2018.  We believe that our current policy stance is appropriate. Since last year, however, we have noted some developments at home and around the world that bear close attention.  Given the overall favorable conditions in our economy, my colleagues and I will be patient in assessing what, if any, changes in the stance of pol icy may be needed.  Let me  explain in more detail how incoming data warrant our current stance and a wait-and-see approach to changes. With the benefit of fiscal stimulus and other tailwinds, growth in 2018 was strong \u2014in fact, at 3.1 percent, the strongest  year in more than a decade.  For some time, most forecasts have called for growth to continue in 2019 at a somewhat lower but still healthy pace.  For example, last September, Committee participants saw growth coming in at about 2.5 perce nt this year. Data arriving since September suggest that growth is slowing somewhat more than expected.  Financial conditions tightened considerably over the fourth quarter.  While conditions\n\nMarch 20, 2019      Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nPage 2 o f 23 have eased since then, they remain less supportive of growth than during most of 2018.  Growth has slowed in some foreign economies \u2014notably , in Europe and China.  While the U.S. economy showed little evidence of slowdown through the end of 2018, the limited data we have so far this year have been somewhat more mixed.  Unusually strong payroll job growth in January was followed by little growth at all in February.  Smoothing through these variations, average monthly job growth appears to have stepped down from last year\u2019s strong pace, but job gains remain well above the pace necessary to provide jobs for new labor force entrants.  Many other labor market indicators continue to show strength.  Weak retail sales data for December bounced back considerably in January but , on balance , seem to point to somewhat slower growth in consumer spending.  Business fixed investment also appears to be growing at a slower pace than last year.  Inflation has been muted, and some indicators of longer -term inflation expectations remain at the low end  of their ranges in recent years.  Along with these developments, unresolved policy issues , such as Brexit and the ongoing trade negotiations , pose some risks to the outlook. Much of the discussion at our meeting focused on what we should make of the varie d indicators.  Today\u2019s Summary of Economic Projections, the SEP, reflects the assessments of individual Committee participants.  And these views are in line with a broad range of other forecasts and point to a modest slowdown, with overall conditions remai ning favorable.  FOMC participants sought \u2014now see 2019 growth at roughly 2 percent, with the unem ployment rate remaining below 4  percent.  Core inflation, which omits the effects of volatile food and energy prices, remains close to 2  percent.  Declines in oil prices since last fall are expected to push headline inflation below 2 percent for a time, but this effect is likely to be temporary.  Now , I\u2019m\n\nMarch 20, 2019      Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nPage 3 o f 23 describing views of the most likely outcomes, but historical experience reminds us that growth and inflation this year could be stronger or wea ker than what we now project. The federal funds rate is now in the broad range of estimates of neutral \u2014the rate that tends neither to stimulate nor to restrain the economy.  As I noted, my colleagues and I think that this setting is well suited to the current outlook and believe that we should be patient in assessing the need for any change in the stance of policy.  \u201cPatient \u201d means that we see no need to rush to judgment.  It may be some time before the outlook for jobs and inflation calls clearly for a change in policy. In discussing the Committee\u2019s projections, it\u2019s  useful to note what those projections are, as well as what they are not.  The SEP includes participants\u2019 individual projections of the most likely economic sc enario , along with their views of the appropriate path of the federal funds rate in that scenario.  Views about the most likely scenario form one input into our policy discussions.  We also discuss other plausible scenarios, including the risk of more worr isome outcomes.  These and other scenarios and many other considerations go into policy but are not reflected in projections of the most likely case.  Thus, we always emphasize that the interest rate projections in the SEP are not a Committee decision.  They are not a Committee plan.  As Chair Yellen noted some years ago, t he FOMC statement , rather than the dot plot,  is the device that the Committee uses to express its opinions about the likely path of rates . Today the Committee released Balance Sheet Normalization Principles and Plans \u2014 revised Balance Sheet Normalization Principles and Plans .  We have long said that the size of the balance sheet will be considered normalized when the balance sheet is once again at the smallest level consistent with conductin g monetary policy efficiently and effectively.  We have sought to make the normalization process transparent, predictable, and gradual in order to minimize\n\nMarch 20, 2019      Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nPage 4 o f 23 disruption and risks to our dual -mandate objectives.  Today\u2019s announcement is the result of discussi ons over the past four FOMC meetings about how best to achieve these goals.  The plans have many technical details, and I\u2019ll be happy to answer questions on those details .  But, for now, I\u2019ll summarize the key elements. Since October 2017, we have been allowing our asset holdings to decline by not reinvesting all of the payments we receive as securities matured or were prepaid.  Today we announced that we intend to slow the runoff of our assets starting in May and to cease runoff entirely in September of  this year. In September, reserve balances may still be somewhat above the level required to conduct policy efficiently and effectively.  If this is so, we may hold the size of our asset holdings roughly constant for a time.  During this time, ongoing gradual increases in currency and our other nonreserve liabilities would imply very gradual declines in reserve balances.  When the Committee judges that reserves should not decline further, securities holdings will again begin to rise, as dictated by the grow th of demand for our reserve and nonreserve liabilities.  We believe that these plans will facilitate a predictable, transparent, and smooth process, and we will make additional adjustments if conditions warrant. The Committee will soon turn to a few remaining normalization topics, including the desired maturity composition of our portfolio of Treasury securities.  We maintain our long- stated intention to return to a portfolio consisting mainly of Treasury securities. Thank you.  And I will be glad to take your questions. HEATHER LONG.  Heather Long from the Washington Post.  On the broader economy, can you clarify how worried the FOMC is about a steep slowdown?   Some of the actions today\n\nMarch 20, 2019      Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nPage 5 o f 23 look like there is more worry .  And on the balance sheet, can you clar ify:  Does the FOMC see the runoff as  a form of monetary tightening? CHAIR POWELL.  So, on the outlook, our outlook is a positive one.  So, as I mentioned, we saw  back in \u2014at the end of last year.  And part of that is seeing that economic fundamentals \u2014underlying economic fundamentals are still very strong.  You have a strong labor market by most measures.  You have rising incomes.  You \u2019ve got very low unemployment.  You have confiden ce surveys for households and also for businesses that are at attractive levels, and you also have financial conditions that are more accommodative than they were a couple of months ago.  So we see the outlook as a positive one. As far as  balance sheet \u2014the balance sheet plan, the answer to that is, you asked whether that\u2019s related to our monetary policy , in effect, and the answer is really \u201c no.\u201d  We are\u2014we still\u2014 we think of the interest rate tool as the principal tool of monetary policy, and we think of ourselves as returning the balance sheet to a normal level over the course of the next six months . And we \u2019re not really thinking of those as two different tools of monetary policy. STEVE LIESMAN.  Steve Liesman, CNBC.  Mr. Chairman, can you talk about how global developments are affecting the U.S.?  What \u2019s the cause of the weakness over there?  How much is it responsible for the downgrade in GDP over here ?  And what impact are tariffs , both in the United States and retal iatory tariffs , having on both the U.S. and the global economies? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL.  So the global economy was a tailwind for the United States in 2017. That was the year of synchronized global growth.   And we began 2018 expecting and hoping for more of the same.  What happened instead is that the global economy started to gradually slow,\n\nMarch 20, 2019      Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nPage 6 o f 23 and now we see a situation where the European economy has slowed substantially \u2014and so has the Chinese economy, although the European economy more.  And just as st rong global growth was a tailwind, weaker global growth can be a headwind to our economy.  How big is that effect?  It \u2019s hard to be precise about it, but , clearly , we will feel that.  It is an integrated global economy, and global financial markets are int egrated as well. In terms of what \u2019s causing it, it seems to be a range of different things.  In China , you have, you know, factors that are very specific to China.  The main point , though, is that, I would say, the outlook\u2014let \u2019s look at the outlook.  Chinese authorities have taken many steps since the middle of last year to support economic activity, and I think the base case is that , ultimately , Chinese activity will stabilize at an attractive level.  And in Europe, you know, we see some weakening, but, again, we don\u2019 t see\u2014we don\u2019 t see recession, and w e do see positive growth still. You ask about tariffs.  I would say , tariffs may be a factor in China.  I don\u2019 t think they \u2019re the main factor.  I think the main factors are the de levering campaign that th e government undertook a couple of years ago and also just the longer -term slowing to a more sustainable pace of growth that economies find as they mature.  In terms of our own economy, the level of tariffs is relatively small in the size of our economy \u2014relative to the size of our economy.  We have, since the beginning of the year \u2014and before , really \u2014been hearing from our extensive network of business contacts a lot of concerns about tariffs, concerns about material costs on imported products , and the loss of markets and things like that, depending on which industry , so there \u2019s a fair amount of uncertainty.  It\u2019s hard to say how much of an effect that \u2019s having on our economy. It\u2019s very hard to tease that apart .  But I will say , it\u2019s been a prominent concern among our business contacts for some time now.\n\nMarch 20, 2019      Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nPage 7 o f 23 JAMES PUZZANGHERA.  Hi.  Thank you, Chairman.  I want to switch gears temporarily to Wells Fargo.  Wells Fargo last week announced that its chief executive received a 5 percent pay raise last year, and this comes among continued settlements by the bank of various consumer abuse and reports that new consumer -unfriendly sales incentives are returning.  Do you have concerns about Wells Fargo \u2019s efforts to fix its problems, and do you expect the asset cap to remai n in place beyond this year? CHAIR POWELL.  Wells Fargo.  So what happened at Wells Fargo really was a remarkably widespread series of breakdowns , really , in their risk -management apparatus, which resulted in significant consumer abuses , let\u2019s say.  And as  it\u2019s gone on and on, it \u2019s become clear that\u2014I think some time ago it became clear that these are deep problems that needed to be addressed in a fundamental kind of a way.  So there \u2019s a lot of work to do on that .  And we put in place, really , an unprecedented sanction in the form of an asset growth cap, and we will not lift that until Wells Fargo gets their arms around this, comes forward with plans, implements those plans, and we \u2019re satisfied with what they \u2019ve done.  And that \u2019s not where we are right now. JAMES PUZZANGHERA.  Do you believe it \u2019s appropriate \u2014do you believe it \u2019s appropriate for the CEO to be getting a pay raise in light of those conditions , in terms of corporate governance? CHAIR POWELL.  You know, our main supervisory focus is on the company fixing its risk-management approach and fundamentally rebuilding that approach.  We don\u2019 t approve individual pay packages.  We do supervise boards of directors for, you know, for having a set of compensation practices that don\u2019 t reward short -term risk -taking and that sort of thing.  And w e will supervise based on that.\n\nMarch 20, 2019      Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nPage 8 o f 23 MICHAEL MCKEE.   Michael McKee with Bloomberg Radio and Television.  I wonder if you could discuss the balance of risks.  I know you said that the outlook among the C ommittee members is a positive one, but since the end o f the meeting, the 3- month\u2013 10-year Treasury spread has fallen to 7 basis  points, and now, according to f ed funds futures trading, there \u2019s a 50 percent chance of a rate cut by next January.  How far off are  the market s?  W hat do you think the risks actually are? CHAIR POWELL.  Well, first, the data are not currently sending a signal that we need to move in one direction or another, in my view.  I would say it this way :  We see a positive outlook for this year, a favorable out look for this year, as I mentioned.  So, in our SEP projections, C ommittee members, participants, generally see growth of around 2 percent.  They see unemployment remaining below 4 percent.  They see inflation remaining close to target. And they see growth, as I said, around 2 percent.  So, you know, that \u2019s a positive outlook.  It\u2019s a favorable outlook.  We \u2019re also very mindful \u2014and we have been, of course, all along \u2014of what the risks are.  And you see \u2014you mentioned  some of them .  You know , you see slowing global growth.  You still have \u2014there\u2019 s no resolution of Brexit.  There\u2019 s no resolution, really , of the trade talks.  These are ongoing risks.  We \u2019re also carefully monitoring what \u2019s happening with U.S. growth.  We called that out in our st atement.  You know, the limited data that we have do show a slowdown.  On the other hand, as I mentioned, we see the underlying economic fundamentals for growth this year as still very positive.  So that \u2019s really how we\u2019 re thinking about it. JIM TANKERSLEY.  Hi, Mr. Chairman.  Jim Tankersley, New York Times.   I\u2019m curious, you\u2019re now a full percentage point \u2014actually , more than a percentage point \u2014below the White House in your projections for growth this year.  By my calculations, that \u2019s the largest spread\n\nMarch 20, 2019      Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nPage 9 o f 23 we\u2019ve seen since the end of the recession b etween the White House and the F ed.  Why, for one, do you see \u2014do you think you see the economy so differently than they do, and do you worry at all about imp lications for policy from that? CHAIR POWELL.  I haven \u2019t\u2014I haven \u2019t seen their projection.  I wouldn\u2019 t comment on their projection.  I would take it this way.  You can think of growth as being composed of two things.  And one is really growth in the workforce \u2014more hours worked.  And the other is productivity \u2014it\u2019s output per hour.  You can really think of growth as those two things.  And I \u2019ve been calling \u2014often mentioning  these days that it would be great if we had national -level policies to support higher labor force participation.  The United States is now one of t he lowest countries among the advanced economies , in terms of our labor force participation by prime -age workers. And that \u2019s a place where we can grow faster.  If we can bring more people into the labor force and give them a chance to contribute to and benefit from our overall prosperity, that will be a great thing for the country.  So  I would like to see that. Productivity is much harder.  It\u2019s v ery difficult to  project productivity over long stretches of time.  It\u2019s a function of evolving technology.  So , I guess I would say, what is the potential growth rate?  It\u2019s quite hard to know with any precision, and I just would like to see us, you know, undertake an ef fort to make it be as  high as it can sustainably be. JIM TANKERSLEY.   A quick follow -up on that .  Do you see the tax cuts \u2014the 2017 tax cuts as having provided a large boost to labor force  participation as the White House does ? CHAIR POWELL.  I would say so.  I think it \u2019s clear that the tax and spending policies that were adopted early last year supported demand in a significant way last year.  And it \u2019s also the case, I think, that they should have some supply -side effects.  I think it \u2019s hard to know, it \u2019s hard to identify those with any precision, and we hope they \u2019re\u2014we hope they \u2019re very large.  You\n\nMarch 20, 2019      Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nPage 10 o f 23 know, the idea would be that lowering corporate taxes would spur more corporate investment, which would spur more productivity, and lowering individual taxes would spur greater labor force participation.  I wouldn\u2019 t want to be handing \u2014you know, assigning credit  or blame for that, but I do think that the performance of labor force participation over the last , really , three or four years has been an upside surprise that most people didn\u2019 t see coming, and it \u2019s extremely welcome. MARTIN CRUTSINGER.  Marty Crutsinger  with the Associated Press.  With the new dot plot today, you\u2019 ve gone from two rate hikes in 2019 to zero.  You still have one showing for next year.  The f ed funds futures trading , as has been alluded to, is  showing rate cuts at the end of this year.  Are they \u2014is that a possibility in your mind , given the sharp change you\u2019 ve made at this meeting? CHAIR POWELL.   As I mentioned, the data that we \u2019re seeing are not currently sending a signal which suggests moving in either direction for me, which is really why we \u2019re being patient. We feel our policy rate is in the range of neutral.  The economy is growing at about  trend. Inflation is close to target.  Une mployment is under 3 percent.1  It\u2019s a great time for us to be patient and watch and wait and see how things evolve. VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi.  Victoria Guida  with Politico.  On stress testing, I wanted to ask, how do you respond to criticism that the F ed\u2019s recent move to remove the qualitative objection from CCAR makes it less transparent to the general public?  And then, also, Governor Brainard dissented on that decision, and she \u2019s dissented on some other decisions as  well regulatorily recently.  Does  it concern you, given that the F ed has traditionally been a consensus -\n\n1 Chair Powell intended to say that the unemployment rate is under 4 percent.\n\nMarch 20, 2019      Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nPage 11 o f 23 based organization, if you keep having thes e decisions where, you know, a B oard member is not onboard with them? CHAIR POWELL.  So you mentioned the qualitative aspect of CCAR .  And U.S .\u2014the large U.S. financial institutions have made significant progress there and are now much better at the capital planning process .  And for , really , some time now, for a couple of years, we \u2019ve talked about moving supervision of that process \u2014moving to a supervisory approach to that rather than having a pass/fail in the stress tests .  We \u2019ve been talking about that for quite a while .  And I think, given the level that the banks have moved to in capital planning, we did that .  It shouldn\u2019 t be a big surprise \u2014something we \u2019ve been talking a bout doing for a couple of years.  For banks that are newer to CCAR and haven \u2019t made that kind of progress, then they \u2019re still going to be part of \u2014they \u2019re still going to have a qualitative test until they can reach  similar levels of achievement. In terms of having disparate views, I \u2014look, we try \u2014we are very much a consensus - driven organization.  We try very hard to reach consensus on things.  In the end, it \u2019s very healthy to have disparate v iews and to state them publicly and put them on the record.  It\u2019s nothing but healthy from my standpoint.  We \u2019ll always be trying to reach consensus, and, you know, I \u2019m committed to that. TREVOR HUNNICUTT.  Trevor Hunnicutt from Reuters.  Just \u2014you mentione d that you have , kind of , a positive outlook as it regards the economy but also see slower growth on the household side and the business side.  Given how big of a part of the U.S. economy that is, what gives you, kind of , confidence that both the slowdown we \u2019re seeing is temporary ? CHAIR POWELL.  So on the household side, what we saw was a very weak reading on retail sales in December and then a bounceback in the January reading .  And, you know, it was a\n\nMarch 20, 2019      Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nPage 12 o f 23 surprise, I would say, and inconsistent with a signif icant amount of other data.  We \u2019re not dismissing it in any way, but I would go back to, what is it that supports consumer spending ? It\u2019s 70 percent of the economy, as you point out .  It\u2019s strong economic underlying fundamentals , so, rising wages, high levels of employment, low levels of unemployment, high levels of job creation , confidence.  The household confidence surveys have moved back up to where they were last summer.  So we look at those fundamentals, and we think that looks l ike a setting in which consumption will have support from underlying economic fundamentals.  And that \u2019s really what we\u2019 re thinking there.  So, you know, we \u2019re also patiently watching and waiting and not assuming.  We \u2019re not taking no signal from the incomi ng data ; that\u2019s why we called it out in our statement.  So I t hink our eyes are open on this. NICK TIMIRAOS.   Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.  Chair Powell, in 1998 the Fed eased policy in a way that some say may have avoided a recession, others say may have helped fuel the NASDAQ tech stock bubble .  And financial conditions have eased considerably this year since the policy pivot that you made clear in January .  The S&P, for example, is  just 3 percent below last summer \u2019s peak.  And so, I wonder, does this episode from 20 years ago bear at all on your thinking today about the risks posed by rising asset values in an environm ent of a shallower policy path? CHAIR POWELL.  We \u2019re in a very different world today and post -crisis, because we now very care fully monitor financial conditions and financial stability concerns on an ongoing basis, and we publish a report twice a year, and we have quarterly Board meeting s and briefings where we look deeply into these things.  So this is something we have very much on our radar screen.  And I would say , overall , we don \u2019t see financial stability vulnerabilities as high.  There are some aspects of the financial markets that we\u2019 re carefully monitoring, and those are in the\n\nMarch 20, 2019      Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nPage 13 o f 23 nature o f things that might b e amplifiers to a downturn\u2014as opposed to a financial stability concern, which might lead to a financial crisis and that kind of thing, which we don\u2019 t see.  So we do monitor that . And I would also say, you know, that the whole question of monetary policy and financial stability is an unsettled and difficult one in our world.  We do think that the principal tools for, you know, for managing financial stability are regulation, supervision, macroprudential tools, and those sorts of things a s opposed to changing the interest rate.  But we \u2019re certainly very mindful of financ ial conditions and those risks. NICK TIMIRAOS.  If I could ask a follow -up\u2014i f it\u2019s the case that we\u2019 re in a lower neutral interest rate world where you could have more asse t price appreciation, do you think the Fed needs more macroprudential tools so that it doesn\u2019 t have to lean  on monetary policy to do so much ? CHAIR POWELL.  It\u2019s a very difficult question with a long answer.  We \u2014in our system, we mainly rely on \u201c through the cycle \u201d tools like high capital and stress tests.  Our financial stability system is built on those tools :  high capital, high liquidity, resolution planning, stress testing.  So those are always on.  We also have some tools, like the countercyclical capital buffer, which we can deploy at times when vulnerabilities are meaningfully above normal.  But we do rely on those tools.  And I would say , our banks are well capitalized.  They \u2019re far better capital ized and better aware of their risks and more liquid than they were before the financial crisis.  So they \u2019ll be more resilient in, you know, in difficult states o f the economy. DONNA BORAK.  Donna Borak with CNN.  Included in the President \u2019s fiscal 2020 budget is a new estimate that the nation \u2019s debt will balloon to more than $31 trillion over the next decade, by 2029.  You\u2019 ve previously said that the country is on an unsustainable fiscal path.\n\nMarch 20, 2019      Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nPage 14 o f 23 How alarming is that number to you ?  And, while the United Sta tes might not be quite there yet, when do you begin to worry about a possible credit crisis? CHAIR POWELL.  I do think that deficits matter, and I do think\u2014 I think it \u2019s not really controversial to say that our debt can \u2019t grow faster than our economy indefi nitely and that \u2019s what it\u2019s doing now.  So this is something we will have to deal with, and I think we can \u2019t really lose sight of that, and I \u2019d like to see a greater focus on that over time.  It\u2019s not in the nature of a near - term debt crisis or anything like that, and I wouldn\u2019 t want to try to predict when that would happen, but it is something that it \u2019s important that the public discussion really come back to, if I can say that .  And we will have to deal with it eventually. JAMES POLITI.   James Politi of the Financial Times.  There\u2019 s huge uncertainty at the moment over the fate of the Brexit negotiations.  How much of a factor has this been for the F ed in turning towards a kind of patient approach to monetary policy, and what \u2019s your base case on that?  And on the size of the balance sheet, what \u2019s your \u2014do you have a numerical estimate for where it will be at the end of Septemb er once the runoff is complete? CHAIR POWELL.  So, of course, we \u2019re watching Brexit carefully and hoping that it can be resolved in an orderly way.  From our standpoint, the part of it that we can control is that we\u2019ve been involved with supervising our financial institutions that are active either in the United Kingdom or the European Union or both to make sure that they \u2019re ready for the  full range of possible outcomes to the \u2014to Brexit.  So \u2014and in doing so, we \u2019ve also had \u2014we \u2019ve also worked alongside regulators from the United Kingdom and the EU.  So we do, again, hope that that can be resolved well, but we know that our banks are well capitalized and resilien t to different kinds of events.\n\nMarch 20, 2019      Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nPage 15 o f 23 In terms of the size of the balance sheet, the balance sheet will be of a size of approximately 17 percent of GDP around the end of this year, down from 25 percent of GDP at the end of 2014\u2014s o, significa ntly smaller relative to GDP than it was.  I\u2019m guess ing you\u2019re looking for a dollar number , though, probably, and that would be \u2014so , for the size of the balance sheet, it looks like it\u2019 ll be a bit above $3.5 trillion then. GREG ROBB.  Greg Robb from MarketW atch.  Chairman Powell, could you talk through your outlook for inflation this year?  Aren\u2019t \u2014you\u2019re  not concerned about it ?  And rising \u2014why aren \u2019t risin g wages feeding into inflation? CHAIR POWELL.  Let me take wages first, if I can.  So wages have moved up in the last couple of years and are now running at healthier , higher levels, and that \u2019s a good thing .  In fact, a lot of the wage gains have been going to lower -paid workers , as can happen late in the cycle, which is also a good thing.  So \u2014but that \u2019s not price inflation , that\u2019s wage inflation.  Our mandate, sorry, is price inflation.  So what I see is inflation that\u2019 s close to 2 percent but that sort of keeps bumping up against 2 percent and then maybe  moving back down a little bit. And I don\u2019t feel that  we have kind of convincingly achieved our 2 percent mandate in a symmetrical way.  Now, what do we mean by \u201c symmetrical\u201d ?  What we really mean is that we would look at \u2014we know that inflation will move around on both sides of the target, and what we say is  that we would be equally concerned with inflation persistently above as  persistently below the target. So that \u2019s really our framework .  And I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve quite achieved that yet, because we\u2019re really 10 years deep in this \u2014almost 10 years \u2014in this exp ansion, and inflation is still kind of, I\u2019d say , not, you know, clearly meeting our target.  So that \u2019s one of the reasons why we \u2019re being patient.  I think, as I\u2019ve said before, I think inflation that is a little bit below our target\u2014\n\nMarch 20, 2019      Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nPage 16 o f 23 particularly headline inflation this year will be, you know, meaningfully below our target for most of the year because of lower oil prices, but we project that  core will be too\u2014t hat gives us the ability to be patient and not move until we see that our target goals are being ac hieved. GREG ROBB.  I just wanted to press a little bit about, what is the story the C ommittee \u2014 you know, when you get in the discussion today and yesterday about inflation, what kind of is the story that emerges? CHAIR POWELL.  So there are a bunch of different stories.  There \u2019s no real easy answer.  One of them is just that the natural rate of unemployment is lower than people think. That\u2019s one way to think about it, that there\u2019 s still more slack in the economy.  Another is tha t expectations play a very \u2014inflation expectations play a very key role in our framework and other frameworks, and, you know, there is the possibility that some people discuss of expectations being anchored but below 2 percent.  And so, either way, inflatio n itself has kind of bounced around a little below 2 percent.  That \u2019s the record. PAUL KIERNAN.   Hi, Chairman Powell .  Thanks for the question.  Paul Kiernan from Dow Jones Newswires.  I\u2019m just kind of curious \u2014I mean , this below -target inflation is a globa l phenomenon, at least across advanced economies, and I\u2019d just like to kind of hear your thoughts about what kind of challenges that poses to policymakers like yourself and the global economy in general.  Ye s, thanks. CHAIR POWELL.  It\u2019s a major challenge.  It\u2019s one of the major challenges of our time, really, to have inflation\u2014 you know, downward pressure on inflation, let \u2019s say.  It gives central banks less room to, you know, to respond to downturns, right ?  So if inflation expectations a re below 2 percent, they \u2019re always going to be pulling inflation down, and we\u2019re going to be paddling upstream in  trying to, you know, keep inflation at 2 percent, which gives us some room\n\nMarch 20, 2019      Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nPage 17 o f 23 to cut, you know, when it\u2019 s time to cut rates when the economy weak ens.  And, you know, that \u2019s something that central banks face all over the world, and we certainly face that problem too.  It\u2019s one of the \u2014one of the things we \u2019re looking into as  part of our strategic monetary policy review this year.  The proximity to the  zero lower bound calls for more creative thinking about ways we can, you know, uphold the credibility of our inflation target, and, you know, we \u2019re open minded about ways we can do that. EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Edward Lawrence from Fox Business Network.  So I counted five downgrades in the first paragraph of the FOMC statement.  What conditions do you need to see in order for a rate cut or a rate hike on the other side of that then? CHAIR POWELL.  Well , we\u2014I think we were \u2014we wanted to be careful to go ahead and acknowledge the things.  I think it\u2019 s relatively little hard data so far this year, but we were careful to point out lower retail sales \u2014the weak November meeting \u2014BFI, all those things , and I think that was the right thing to do.2  Notwithstanding th at, we do have a positive outlook for the year for the reasons I mentioned\u2014 you know, solid underlying economic fundamentals, et  cetera. So, and in terms of what it would take, I\u2019d say, again, today we don\u2019 t see any \u2014we don\u2019 t see data coming in that suggest s that we should move in either direction.  They suggest that we should remain patient and let the situation clarify itself over time.  When the time comes, we \u2019ll act appropriately. MATTHEW BOESLER.  Hi.  Matthew Boesler at Bloomberg.  Fed Vice Chairman Rich Clarida has talked about how the decline in labor \u2019s share of income and the corresponding high profit margins might mean that lower unemployment and high er wage growth is not flowing through to price inflation the way it used to.  Bu t, so far throughout this tightening cycle , the Fed\n\n2 Chair Powell intended to point to  the weak reading on retail sales  for December 2018.\n\nMarch 20, 2019      Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nPage 18 o f 23 has not allowed wage growth to rise above longer -term interest rates until just very recently .  So I\u2019m wondering if , going forward, given these insights about the labor share and high profit margins and t he linkage between wages and prices, would you be in favor of allowing wage growth to continue accel erating without matching that with  higher interest rates? CHAIR POWELL.  Well , let me say that we \u2019ve had, you know, a significant move up in wages and compe nsation over the last few years, and I \u2014which does not trouble me from the standpoint of inflation.  We \u2019ve had \u2014also had \u2014in other cycles, we\u2019ve had situations where, you know, unit labor costs were moving up above inflation, and that didn\u2019 t lead to price inf lation.  It does\u2014you know, in theory, it can squeeze corporate margins , and, you know, that can \u2019t go on indefinitely .  But, nonetheless, I don\u2019t see the current wage picture as concernin g from an inflation standpoint. MATTHEW BOESLER.  More generally, to the extent that wage growth in excess of interest rates allows households to pay down debt faster , whereas interest rates in excess of wage growth risk s a further buildup in debt, how do you account for the sort of financial stability consequences of varyi ng interest  rates relative to wage growth? CHAIR POWELL.  I don\u2019 t think we look at \u2014I understand what you\u2019re asking, but we \u2019re looking at \u2014our mandate is price inflation and maximum employment, and that \u2019s what we \u2019re looking at with setting interest rates.  And we also monitor financial stability very carefully across all meaningful asset categories.  I don\u2019 t think we tie it particularly to the relationship you\u2019re talking about. NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  Nancy Marshall -Genzer  with Marketplace.  Just a quick foll ow-up on Brexit.  You mentioned that you\u2019re making sure that U.S. financial institutions are ready for whatever outcome.  I\u2019m wondering, can you be a little more specific\n\nMarch 20, 2019      Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nPage 19 o f 23 about that ?  And also, how are you preparing for any pressures that a hard Brexi t would put on the U.S. dollar? CHAIR POWELL.  Well, as I mentioned, you know, with the stress test s that the largest financial institutions \u2014and those are the ones that tend to be active internationally \u2014that they undergo every year, we put them through very  large financial shocks with large losses and big changes in markets every year.  And we vary that every year.  So that \u2019s a pretty good \u2014you know, having done that for a number of years now, that \u2019s\u2014and having them be required to have adequate capital and li quidity even after all that happens.  So that \u2019s a good thing to have done , knowing that you\u2019re going into something that \u2019s quite unknown, which may prove stressful , it may not prove stressful , depending on what the outcome is.  So I think all that has probably prepared our institutions well.  That said, nothing like this has happened in recent years, and so it\u2019s really hard to be confident.  So we \u2019re very watchful about what \u2019s going on. NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  And as far as the dollar goes? CHAIR POWELL.  S o we don\u2019 t\u2014you know, we \u2014the dollar is really the business of the Treasury Department.  It\u2019s certainly a financial condition unto itself that plays into our models, but we don\u2019 t, you know, seek or model or attempt to affect the dollar directly with our policies . JOHN HELTMAN.  Hi.  John Heltman\u2014 John Heltman with American Banker.   I have a question about the F ed\u2019s proposal from October of last year regarding enhanced prudential standards for banks above $250 billion.  Some analysts have suggested that tha t proposal could encourage consolidation mergers and acquisition among banks , particularly at the upper end of the range.  I\u2019m curious if the F ed anticipated that outcome and whether you have any reservations or whether you\u2014the F ed cares about ban k consoli dation more generally.\n\nMarch 20, 2019      Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nPage 20 o f 23 CHAIR POWELL.  We \u2019re not motivated by a particular view of industry structure that we\u2019re trying to achieve through our regulation.  I think we want to have banks of all different sizes and with different business models out there car rying out their functions in the economy. So that \u2019s how we think about that. I would also say, when banks merge and move into a larger asset category, they get stronger regulation, not weaker regulation.  So if you think about it, you know, if you\u2019re a medium -sized bank and you merge with another medium -sized bank, you w ind up being more than a medium -sized bank, you know. But the sense of our tapering is that \u2014\u201ctailoring, \u201d sorry \u2014our tailoring policy is that the highest expectations fall upon the largest, most systemically important, most complex institutions, and then at every step along the way, the expectations become more tailored to the risks that that institution actually presents to the economy .  So\u2014 BRIAN CHEUNG.  Hi, Chair  Powell.  Brian Ch eung wi th Yahoo Finance.  Thanks for taking my question.  So as the F ed remains on pause, does the c entral bank find the onus on fiscal policy to extend its economic recovery and f end off a slowdown\u2014as in , is the F ed positioning itself to take on a reactionary role to whatever fiscal policy is doing ?  I\u2019m asking because we\u2019re seeing the waning  effect of tax reform and no material news on infrastructure, s o just wondering kind of how you feel the monetary policy \u2013fiscal policy balance is in swing right  now . CHAIR PO WELL.  So we take\u2014we take fiscal policy as, you know, as exogenous to what we do.  You know, in other words, whatever happens with fiscal policy, we take that.  We don\u2019t evaluate it , we don \u2019t criticize it, and we don \u2019t overreact to it either.  So I think it\u2019 s just a fact.  It\u2019s just an external fact about the economy for us.  I mean , our policy is \u2014the reason we \u2019re\n\nMarch 20, 2019      Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nPage 21 o f 23 on hold is that we think our policy rate is in a good place, and we think the economy is in a good place, and we\u2019re watching carefully as we see these events evolve around the world and at home, and we think that \u2019s what we need to be doing. STEVEN BECKNER.   Steve Beckner, freelance journalist reporting for NPR, Mr. Chairman.  The F ed has been allowing the average maturity of securities in its bond  portfolio to lengthen.  Is this aimed at\u2014consciously aimed at flattening the yield curve, and is that going to be part of the Fed\u2019s longer -run balance sheet strategy?  And if flattening the yield curve is a conscious long- term strategy, are you concerned about the side effect of the heightening concerns about a flatter or inverted yield curve being a harbinger of recession ? CHAIR POWELL.  The basic answer to your question is \u201c no.\u201d  We are\u2014the decision about t he maturity composition of the F ed\u2019s balance sheet in the longer run lies ahead of us.  We have not made that decision, and we\u2019re\u2014we really haven \u2019t begun to have a serious series of discussions over a series of meetings to grapple with that.  That, I think, will be something we turn to reasonably soon, but I think it will take some time.  It\u2019s a consequential decision and one that needs some thought.  We \u2019ve had a lot of balance sheet discussions, as I mentioned, over the last four meetings, but this is the next big one that\u2014big decision that w e\u2019ll face.  And, you know, I think we \u2019re not going to be in a rush to resolve it, but we \u2019ll turn to it soon. STEVEN BECKNER.  Can I just follow  up, please?  Well , how do you account for the fact that the average maturity has in fact been lengthening and co ntributing to a flattening of the yield curve?  Is that \u2014what\u2019s \u2014what \u2019s causing that? CHAIR POWELL.  I think, isn \u2019t it just that as securities roll off , you wind up investing in\u2014you know, as a 10- year rolls off, you wind up investing in a 10- year, and automatically  that\n\nMarch 20, 2019      Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nPage 22 o f 23 lengthens things.  It\u2019s not at all a plan to lengthen the balance sheet.  It\u2019s just been \u2014we try to have a practice that we don\u2019 t deviate from , and it\u2019 s transparent , and\u2014no policy message in that. JEAN YUNG.  Hi, Jean Yung with Market New s.  I wanted to ask, at what point do you expect to begin to allow the balance sheet to grow slowly again?  What are\u2014how will you make that decision? CHAIR POWELL.  So, as I \u2014as I mentioned, the balance sheet runoff will stop at about \u2014at September  30.  A nd if it is our view at that time that we \u2019re still a ways away from\u2014a ways above a balance sheet that is what we need to efficiently  and effectively conduct monetary policy, at that time we will hold the balance sheet constant.  A nd then what \u2019ll happen is , organically , very gradually , currency and other nonreserved liabilities will grow , and reserves will shrink. And the question you\u2019re asking is , how long will that go on?  The truth is, we don\u2019 t know, and we don \u2019t really know that we \u2019ll move past September  30th.  The level of reserve demand is something that we \u2019ve put a lot of effort and time into creating estimates , based on market intelligence and surveys and that kind of thing.  The truth is, we don\u2019 t know.  It may evolve over time.  So we \u2019ll just have t o see.  I wouldn\u2019 t want to put a time out there for that, but\u2014so I\u2019ll just leave it th ere. COURTENAY BROWN .  Hi, Mr. Chairman.  Courtenay Brown from Axios.  Are you concerned at all what the market impact will be should the F ed resume policy tig htening somewhere down the line?   As I\u2019m sure you know , the market lis tens to you very, very closely. CHAIR POWELL.  You know, I \u2019m just going to say that I think we \u2019re in a good place right now, which is , we\u2019re being patient, we \u2019re watching , we don\u2019 t see any data pushing us to\n\nMarch 20, 2019      Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nPage 23 o f 23 move rates in either direction, and we \u2019re going to watch carefully and patiently as we allow events to evolve .  And when they do clar ify, we will act appropriately."

At the FOMC meeting that concluded today, we reviewed economic and financial developments in the Uni ted States and around the world and decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged. My colleagues and I have one overarching goal:  to use our monetary policy tools to sustain the economic expansion with a strong job market and stable prices for the benefit of the American people.  Incoming data since our last meeting in March have been broadly in line with our expectations.  Economic growth and job creation have both been a bit stronger than we anticipated, while inflation has been somewhat weaker.  Overall, the economy continues  on a healthy path, and the Committee believes that the current stance of policy is appropriate. The Committee also believes that solid underlying fundamentals are supporting the economy, including accommodative financial conditions, high employment and j ob growth, rising wages, and strong consumer and business sentiment.  Job gains rebounded in March a fter a weak reading in February  and averaged 180,000 per month in the first quarter, well above the pace needed to absorb new entrants to the labor force.  Although first -quarter GDP rose more than most forecasters had expected, growth in private consumption and business fixed investment slowed.  Recent data suggest that these two components will bounce back, supporting our expectation of healthy GDP growth over the rest of the year. The Committee is strongly committed to our symmetric 2 percent inflation objective.  For much of this long expansion, inflation ran a bit below our 2 percent objective, alongside considerable slack in resource utilization.  But last year, with the unemployment rate at or below 4 percent, inflation moved up.  From March through December, core inflation\u2014which excludes volatile food and energy components \u2014was at or very close to 2 percent.  Overall inflation\n\nMay 1, 2019     Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nfluctuated from a few ten ths above 2 percent to a few tenths below over this period, with the moves mostly due to changes in energy prices.  As expected, overall inflation fell at the start of this year as earlier oil price declines worked through the system.  Overall inflation fo r the 12 months ended in March was 1.5 percent.  Core inflation unexpectedly fell as well, however, and as of March stood at 1.6 percent for the previous 12 months.  We suspect that some transitory factors may be at work.  Thus, our baseline view remains t hat, with a strong job market and continued growth, inflation wil l return to 2 percent over time  and then be roughly symmetric around our longer -term objective. At the start of the year, a number of crosscurrents  presented risks to the outlook, including  weak global growth, particularly in China and Europe; the possibility of a disruptive Brexit; and uncertainty around unresolved trade negotiations.  While concerns remain in all of these areas, it appears that risks have moderated somewhat.  Global financ ial conditions have eased, supported in many places around the world by an accommodative shift in monetary policy and, in some cases , fiscal policy.  Recent data from China and Europe show some improvement, and the prospect of a disorderly Brexit has been pushed off for now.  Further, there are reports of progress in the trade talks between the United States and China.  The Committee views these developments, along with the outlook for continued growth, a strong job market, and muted inflation  pressures , as consistent with continued patience in assessing further adjustments in monetary policy. Over the past several months, we have made a number of consequential decisions about our balance sheet.  In January, we decided to continue implementing monetary pol icy using our current policy regime, which involves providing an ample supply of reserves.  In March, we decided to slow the pace of balance sheet runoff , starting this month, and to cease runoff entirely\n\nMay 1, 2019     Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nin September.  These plans support our longer -run dual -mandate objectives and also provide clarity about the path of our asset holdings. Today we had a preliminary discussion about the longer -run maturity composition of the portfolio.  Before the financial crisis, our portfolio was weighted toward shorter -term debt of the federal government.  In the wake of the crisis, the Fed bought a large amount of longer -term securities with the aim of lowering longer -term interest rates and, thus , supporting the recovery. Because of these purchases, our portfolio is now weighted toward longer -term securities.  As part of normalization, we will have to decide what the maturity structure should be in the longer term. This choice raises many complex issues and has possible implications for the stance of policy. Today \u2019s preliminary discussion laid the groundwork for more complete analysis and discussion, and we plan to return to the maturity composition question toward the end of the year.  There is no pressing need to resolve this matter, however, and any decisions we ultimately reach will be implemented with considerable advance notice and in a manner that allows for smooth adjustment.  As we have often emphasized, adjustments to the balance sheet normalization process may well be needed as the process unfolds. Final ly, we made a small technical adjustment in one of our tools for implementing monetary policy :  the interest  rate on excess reserves, or  IOER rate.  The change does not reflect any shift in the intended stance of monetary policy.  We use the IOER rate to help keep the federal funds rate in our target range.  As balance sheet normalization continues, we have expected that the effective federal funds rate would shift up over time relative to the IOER rate. Last year we twice lowered the IOER rate by 5 basis points relative to the top of the target range after the federal funds rate moved toward the top of the range.  These actions helped keep the effective federal funds rate well within the  target  range.  And t oday we made one more such\n\nMay 1, 2019     Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nchange.  The target range for the federal funds rate is our main indicator of the stance of policy, and it remains unchanged. Thank you very much .  I will be glad  to take your questions. STEVE LIESMAN.  Thank you, Mr. Chair .  Steve Liesman, CNBC.  As the statement noted, core inflation is now running below 2 percent \u2014it\u2019s been falling for three straight months , and while you\u2019 ve been close, it \u2019s only been at 2 percent or above one month since 2012.  Mr. Chair , I guess I wonder , is it time to address low inflation through policy , and can you give us some sense of your metric for when it would be time?  At what level would it require a policy response from the Committee? CHAIR POWELL.  So, first, we are strongly committed to our 2 percent inflation objective and to achieving it on a sustained and symmetric basis.  As I mentioned, we think our policy stance is appropriate at the moment, and we don\u2019 t see a strong case for moving in either direction.  I would point out that inflation actually ran\u2014including core inflation \u2014actually ran pretty close to 2 percent for much of 2018. As you point out, both headline and core , though, did come in on the soft side in the first quarter , and that was not expected as it relates to core.  So we say in our S tatement of Longer - Run G oals and M onetary P olicy S trategy that the Committee would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below 2 percent.  So \u201c persistent \u201d carries the sense of something that \u2019s not transient, something that will sustain over a per iod of time.  And in this case, as we look at these readings in the first quarter for core, we do see good reasons to think that some or all of the unexpected decrease may wind up being transient.  And I \u2019d point to things like portfolio management, service prices, apparel prices, and other things.  In addition, the\n\nMay 1, 2019     Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\ntrimmed mean measures of inflation did not go down as much.  I ndeed, the Dallas trimmed mean is at 2 percent. But to go back to your question, if we did see a persistent \u2014inflation running persistently below, then that is something the Committee would be concerned about and something that we would take into account in setting policy. SAM FLEMING.  Thanks very much.  Sam Fleming from the Financi al Times.   Let me carry on on the same theme.  There \u2019s obviously been a lot of speculation in the markets about the prospects for a rate reduction this year.  Do you think markets have effectively gotten ahead of themselves on this?  And what sort of economic conditions would you need to see to give serious consideration of a rate cut?  The discussion, for example, about the 1995 example \u2014do you actually need to see a looming recession to cut rates , or could an insurance cut be appropriate? Thanks. CHAIR P OWELL.  So as I mentioned, we \u2019ve just come through a two- day meeting , and we\u2019ve done a deep dive on economic and financial conditions in the United States and around the world and thought about our policy , and we do think our policy stance is appropriate r ight now. We don\u2019 t see a strong case for moving in either direction.  So \u2014 w e do, of course , though\u2014as a routine matter , as you well know \u2014we look not only at our baseline , but we also look at alternative simulations, both better and worse , and we ask ourselves what the appropriate policy response would be .  But that \u2019s all we do .  And I would just say that we \u2019re comfortable \u2014the Committee is comfortable with our current policy stance. HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Hi.  Howard Schneider with Reuters.  Shifting gear s a little bit, I wondered if you could flesh out \u2014I know you\u2019 re describing it as a small technical adjustment , but on the IOER federal funds spread, give us a sense of why it matters whether or\n\nMay 1, 2019     Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nnot this breaches the upper limit a little bit.  Is there any f eed-throug h to broader credit conditions and financial conditions that you worry about , or is it simply a matter of the Fed showing that it can control what it says it\u2019 s controlling?  And I do have a follow -up. CHAIR POWELL.  So a small, temporary deviat ion outside of the range would really carry no \u2014wouldn\u2019 t be important, as your question suggests.  But we do think it \u2019s important that we be able to control the federal funds rate and generally keep it within the range.  That \u2019s just good monetary policy, good monetary control.  So we think it \u2019s important , and we have the tools to do that , so we \u2019ve use d them again today .  And, again, this is just a technical fix.  It really has no implications for policy. HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  But a s a follow -up on this, it is demonstrating that you can control the market you want to control.  And I guess the question is , at what point would these steady declines in the IOER \u2014steady widening of this spread , if it continues , essentially become the poli cy choice? CHAIR POWELL.  Ye s, I mean \u2014so , generally speaking, the federal funds rate\u2014we control only directly the federal funds rate in terms of the market rate.  And the transmission of the federal funds rate into other short -term rates \u2014money market rate s\u2014has been very good over a long period of time.  And that \u2019s important , because it \u2019s really broader financial conditions that matter, not so much precisely the federal funds rate.  So I think the Fed controlling the federal funds rate is actually important from that standpoint , and I don\u2019 t see us not controlling it.  So I think we \u2019ll continue to control it , and it will continue to transmit well into broader financial conditions. MICHAEL MCKEE.  Michael McKee with Bloomberg.  I\u2019m curious about the financial conditions that you see out there.  The minutes of the March meeting tell us \u201c a few \u201d officials\n\nMay 1, 2019     Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nworried about financial stability risks.  Was there a broader discussion at this meeting?  Any consensus on whether such risks are growing as the markets hit ne w highs , and we do see some instability in short- end trading \u2014is it possible that rates are too low at this point? CHAIR POWELL.  We actually have a financial stability briefing and opportunity for comment every other meeting.  So we had our quarterly briefing today \u2014yesterday, as a matter of fact\u2014and had that discussion as well.  And I think there haven\u2019 t been a lot of changes since the last meeting , but I \u2019ll just go through the way we think about it.  First, we \u2019ve developed and published our framework for assessing financial stability vulnerabilities \u2014put it out for comment and welcome any feedback that we get from the public.  And that enables us to focus our assessments regularly on the same things so that we can be held accountable and be transparent. So there are four aspects of it that I \u2019ll go through quickly , but I \u2019d say that the headline really is that while there  are some concerns around nonfinancial corporate debt, really the finding is that, overall , financial stability vulnerabilities are mod erate, on balance .  And, in addition, I would say that the financial system is quite resilient to shocks of various kinds with high capital and liquidity.  But the four things we look at are, first, asset prices.  And as for asset prices, some asset prices  are somewhat elevated , but I would say not extremely so. Leverage in the financial sector \u2014I mentioned households are actually in good shape from a leverage standpoint.  Default rates are low.  Borrowing is relatively low.  Nonfinancial corporates is an area that we\u2019 ve spotlighted and focused on for attention, and there are concerns about that \u2014not so much from a financial stability standpoint , but from the standpoint that having a highly levered corporate sector could be an amplifier for a downturn.\n\nMay 1, 2019     Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nAnd then the last two \u2014the last two things are really about the leverage in the financial system and funding risk, and those are both very, very low by historic standards in the United States.  So , on balance, in my view, vulnerabilities are moderate. MICHAEL MCKEE.  If I could follow up on that \u2014I\u2019m just curious as to whether the level of asset prices is a reason why you might not be interested in cutting rates. CHAIR POWELL.   So we do say that risks to the financial system \u2014we say in our longer -run stat ement of goals and monetary policy strategy that risks  to the financial system that could prevent us from achieving our goals are something that we do take into consideration.  I would say  that, though, that really the tools for addressing those concerns a re better \u2014capital liquidity, good supervision, good stress testing, and things like that.  Those are better first -order tools to deal with these kinds of issues than monetary policy. NICK TIMIRAOS.  Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.  Chair Powell,  with the benefit of hindsight, did last year \u2019s rate increases make it harder for the Fed to credibly affirm its 2 percent symmetric inflation target is not, in fact , a ceiling?   And, if so, would it be appropriate to lower rates if core inflation remained  persistently closer to 1 \u00bd percent instead of 2 percent? And, if not, do you worry about any unwelcome tightening in real rates , given the recent softness in core inflation? CHAIR POWELL.  So, to your first question, if you go back and think about the middle of last year, inflation was at 2 percent and appeared to be staying there.  And the economy was quite strong and was growing strong.  The fiscal changes were hitting the economy in a very positive way.  And so I think the expectation was that inflat ion would remain up around 2 percent.   The weak first quarter performance was not expected \u2014of core was not expected , and I don \u2019t think is related to anything we did , in terms of raising rates.   It appears to be more \u2014we\n\nMay 1, 2019     Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\ndon\u2019t know this, but you never know until\u2014with hindsight, with perfect hindsight , but some of it does appear to be transient or idiosyncratic.  Now,  the second part of your question?  Sorry. NICK TIMIRAOS.  Well, I mean, if it was an issue, would it be appropriate to lower rates if co re infl ation held closer to 1\u00bd percent?  And, if not, are you worried that there is unwanted tightening from real rates , being where they are? CHAIR POWELL.  Yes, I mean \u2014so , as I said earlier, we do address this in our , sort of , constitutional document.  If infl ation were to run persistently below 2 percent or persistently above 2 percent, that would be a concern for the Committee , and the Committee would take that into account in making policy.  I do think it \u2019s important that inflation run close to and sustainably \u2014for a sustained period of time \u2014and symmetrically around 2 p ercent .  Because if it doesn \u2019t, you run the risk that inflation expectations can\u2014it has been the case, most of the misses are on the downside \u2014inflation expectations over time could be pulled down, and that could put downward pressure on inflation and make it harder for us to react to downturns and harder for us to, you know, support the economy in difficult times. JEANNA SMIALEK.  Jeanna Smialek, New York Times.   So as you just mentioned, las t year when you guys were kind of getting inflation coming in around 2 percent, you had this benefit of the tailwind of fiscal stimulus.  And you still have that to some extent, although the tax cuts have mostly fe eded through\u2014 we\u2019ve still got something in the pipeline from the spending cap increases.  So , I guess, how do you think about inflation as that fiscal benefit wanes toward the end of this year? CHAIR POWELL.  Inflation, first of all\u2014month- to-month, quarter -to-quarter \u2014is going to move around.  Ther e will always be factors hitting it.  So probably the biggest single factor driving it is the rate of underlying inflation or the closely related idea of where inflation\n\nMay 1, 2019     Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nexpectations are anchored \u2014the thought being , that \u2019s where inflation will go in the long run if it \u2019s not been pushed by those other factors.  So we also think that slack\u2014the level of slack in the economy does play some small role.  It\u2019s actually still a measurable role.  It\u2019s nothing like it was in the 1960s when the Phillips curve was quite  steep, so that \u2019s also something that plays a role. And so we take all those things into account , and the part of it that we can control is the slack part.  And , again, we do expect that this reading will be transient and inflation will move back up.  And if it isn \u2019t and if it runs persistently below 2 percent for a sustained period, then that\u2019s something we \u2019d take into account in setting policy. DONNA BORAK.  Chairman Powell, Donna Borak with CNN.  Pivoting a little bit\u2014 about wages, since 2010, women\u2019 s real earnings have gone up about 3.9 percent compared to men\u2019s, which have risen about 2.1.  Do you think the relative increase in women\u2019 s wages is a problem for the U .S. economy? CHAIR POWELL.   You know, I think, generally, I \u2019d have to see the data on that.  It sounds like you picked a particular time frame .  Over time, I really wonder whether that \u2019s the case.  You know, I think men and women should make the same for the same work, by and large. So\u2014 DONNA BORAK.  Just to push a little bit on this .  But if the data shows that women \u2019s wages are rising higher, is there a damage to the U .S. economy if male\u2019 s wages are declining or not growing as fast as women \u2019s? CHAIR POWELL.  So I think we \u2019re getting in here to commenting on a nominee to the Fed indirectl y, and that \u2019s something I \u2019d rather avoid.  It\u2019s really not my role to engage with potential nominees to the F ed, so I \u2019m really not going to go there.  I haven \u2019t seen this research either , so I don\u2019 t really \u2014really  know.  Thanks.\n\nMay 1, 2019     Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nVICTORIA GUIDA.  Victoria Guida with Politico.  I wanted to ask \u2014early last month, I believe it was April 2, the Fedwire \u00ae system went down.  A nd I was just wondering if you could talk about what happened there, how long it lasted, whether you know what happened, whether you\u2019re still looking into it, and whether it\u2019 s something that could happen again. CHAIR POWELL.  Sure.  So that \u2019s right.  I want to say it was April 1 , but it may have been April 2.  In any case, the Fedwire\u00ae did go down for a few hours, in the three - or fou r-hour range.  We were able to quickly identify the problem :  It was an internal problem , and we were able to correct it and make changes so that that problem and other problems like it cannot repeat themselves.   So, you know, we learn from these instances .  They \u2019re fairly rare , but we learn from them , and in this case it was interna l, and it \u2019s been corrected. STEVE MATTHEWS.  Steve Matthews with Bloomberg.   Next month, we have the 10th anniversary of the end of the recession , and there are some countries that have had expansions for 15, 20, 25 years.  Do you think that \u2019s something that \u2019s practical for the U .S., that  we could have that kind of lengthy expansion?  And for you personally, if we had a recession during your tenure,  would you consider that a failure? CHAIR POWELL.  You know, I wouldn\u2019 t want to speculate.  There \u2019s always the example of Australia that everyone, I think, is aware of , where I think they \u2019re in year 28 of their expansion.  So things are possible.  All I c an see is that we have an economy where the expansion is continuing.  Growth is at a healthy level.   The labor market is strong.  We see job creation.  We see wages moving up.  Inflation is low, which gives us the ability to be patient , and we do expect it  to move up, and we want it to move up to 2 percent.  So I see us on a good path for this year.\n\nMay 1, 2019     Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nSTEVE MATTHEWS.  Do you see parallels with the 1990s , when \u2014for example, some people have pointed out, in the U .S., the longest expansion before this one , there was a rate cut in 1995, and rates went up , and then they came down , and there was that kind of management.  Do you see similarities in today \u2019s situation? CHAIR POWELL.  Similarities in the length.  I mean, the situations were quite different then.  This was before inflation really was under control , but, you know, it\u2019 s very interesting to look at the history.  I find it quite interesting to look at different periods.  But I think, in our own cycle, we face a particular set of challenges that are really wh at\u2019s relevant for us now. MARTIN CRUTSINGER.   Mr. Chairman, Marty Crutsinger with the AP.  You \u2019ve repeatedly said that the F ed\u2019s going to conduct monetary policy without regard to outside political pressure , but it seems like the P resident is intent on in creasing that political pressure. Yesterday, he said you should cut rates a full percentage point and start quantitative easing. What do those comments do, in terms of affecting how you pursue policy and how you convey your decisions to the public? CHAI R POWELL.  Ye s, so, as you know, we are a nonpolitical institution,  and that means we don \u2019t think about short -term political considerations, we don\u2019 t discuss them, and we don\u2019t consider them in making our decisions one way or the other.  And what we \u2019re alw ays solving for in our process, in our work, is to carry out our mission, which is to extend the economic expansion, keep the labor market strong, and get inflation around 2 percent. So to give you an idea of what our process is like , maybe as a way of pu tting all that in context \u2014so for the past maybe 10 days, all 17 FOMC members will have made extensive preparations :  catching up on the latest data, reading all the memos, talking to their colleagues and their staff.  As you also are I \u2019m sure aware, Marty,  we talk to literally thousands of\n\nMay 1, 2019     Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nbusinesspeople and market people and people in the nonprofit sector and the educational sector just to get a better sense of the economy.  We put all that together , and we come together for two days. The first day begins  with an economic briefing, which is , sort of , economic and financial developments in the United States and around the world.  That takes up most of the first day , and we talk about this in great detail.  We go away, we think about that, and we come back, and the next day we talk about monetary policy.  And in this particular case, we came to a unanimous decision , after an extensive discussion , that our monetary policy stance is appropriate where it is. And we think our monetary policy stance is in a good place, and we \u2019re going to be patient as we consider adjustments.  And we also see, by the way, the evolving -risk picture as very consistent with that outlook. So we don\u2019 t feel like the data \u2019s pushing us in either direction.  Of course, we \u2019ll not hesitate  if we do feel that the data justify moving in either direction.  But that \u2019s our process. That\u2019s how we think about things.  We don\u2019 t think about other factors.  We don\u2019 t let them into our decisionmaking.  We don\u2019 t discuss them. PAUL KIERNAN.  Paul Kiern an from Dow Jones Newswires.  Thanks for the question. In the l ast 23 years, core PCE inflation has run above 2 percent only during the period that coincided with the housing bubble.  I\u2019d like to know what you would say to people who worry that it will pr ove difficult for the F ed to lift inflation without potentially stoking another asset bubble of some sort.  Thank you. CHAIR POWELL.  Ye s.  So you\u2019 re pointing to, really , the fact that in recent years inflation has moved down and down, and, really, many major central banks have struggled to reach their inflation goals from below.  And that includes us, although we \u2019ve actually done \u2014\n\nMay 1, 2019     Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nwe\u2019ve come closer, I think, than most others.  And it \u2019s just a question, I think, of demographic and other large and, in some cases, global forces that are disinflationary to some extent , and it creates significant challenges.  One, I would say, is , it means that interest rates will be lower \u2014 will be closer to the effective lower bound more of the time because t hat means lower interest rates.  And that \u2019s one of the reasons we \u2019re having a review of our monetary policy strategies, tools, and communications this year \u2014to think about that problem. You mentioned the connection to financial stability of lower -for-longe r rates , and that is another challenge.  As I mentioned earlier, we do consider financial stability concerns to the extent they threaten achievement of our goals , but we also view, and I do take the view that macroprudential and supervisory tools, regulatory tools, things like the stress tests that we can do right through the cycle \u2014those are really the best defense against financial instability so that the financial system is highly resilient to the kinds of financial shocks that can happen. GREG ROBB.  Th ank you.  Greg Robb from MarketWatch.  This morning, the ISM manufacturing i ndex fell to have its worst reading since October 2016.  So isn\u2019 t that a dark cloud on your outlook for strong growth for the rest of the year?  I mean, how much weight does it hold for you, and is it a sign that monetary policy might be too tight? CHAIR POWELL.   This is the ISM reading, I guess from this morning , on manufacturing.  Ye s, we see that reading as \u2014it\u2019 s still a positive reading and consistent with what we expect from the manufacturing sector, which is moderate or perhaps modest growth. Manufacturing has been weak all around the world.  Services have been growing faster.  So it\u2019s\u2014yes, it \u2019s something tha t we are watching carefully , but we do expect a positive contribution to growth from the manufacturing sector.\n\nMay 1, 2019     Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nEDWARD LAWRENCE.  Edward Lawrence from Fox Business.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for doing this.  You mentioned\u2014talked about domestic growth a little bit with the economy.  You mentioned that the progress in the talks with China trade, progress in talks with Japanese trade, the USMCA is moving or going to move through Congress.  Could you talk about a little bit of the domestic growth that you \u2019re seeing going forward for the rest of the year ? And could these trade deals turn into tailwinds for the economy? CHAIR POWELL.  Our outlook and my outlook is for\u2014is a positive one, is a healthy one for the U .S. economy for growth for the rest of this year.  A nd I would say that the basis for that, really , is consumer spending and business investment.  So if you look at consumer spending, you saw stronger retail sales, stronger motor vehicle sales in March.  A nd, as I mention ed, the conditions, the broader economic fundamentals, are strong in support of consumer spending \u2014that\u2019s more accommodative financial conditions, high confidence readings, high levels of employment, wages going up.  All those things are going to support consumer spending.  So that \u2019s a significant part of the outlook this year.  And business investment should also be positive in that sort of direction. In terms of the effect of trade deals, I think one thing would be that the resolution of the uncertainty a round these trade negotiations would, I would guess, be a positive for business sentiment.  We have been hearing from our business contacts , really , a lot since the beginning of the trade negotiations that uncertainty is a concern.  If you import metals or  whatever for your product or export your product, then it \u2019s been a challenge for you.  So that would be a positive. And, of course, most of the gains , though, I would expect, even from a successful trade negotiation, would come in over time.  You know, I don\u2019t think\u2014i t wouldn\u2019 t be the kind of thing where you \u2019d immediately feel big effects right away , but they could be quite important over a\n\nMay 1, 2019     Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nlonger period.  So that, I think\u2014that would be my expectation.  I don \u2019t know , though.  I haven \u2019t seen\u2014none of us, at  least I haven \u2019t seen, the details of what \u2019s been negotiated. DON LEE.  Don Lee with the L .A. Times.   Getting back to inflation, can you talk more about the transitory factors holding down inflation, how significant they are, and why you think those facto rs will pass? CHAIR POWELL.  Sure.  Well, I would just mention a couple.  Let me say, I don \u2019t mean to diminish concerns about too- low inflation , but I think there \u2019s good reason to think that these readings are particularly influenced by some transitory factors. One that I would mention is portfolio management services, which would tend to go down when asset prices go down, with a lag.  And so when asset prices went back up, probably there\u2019 ll be a swing around there, a positive contribution.  Other ones that get mentioned are things like apparel , and apparel prices were very, very low.  There was a change in the methodology.  And another one is airfares.  There are many little things.  So we don\u2019 t know until, again, until we see , but there \u2019s reason to think that those would be transient and would turn around. And another way to look at it is , there are models that look at inflation in different ways , like\u2014not models, but measures , like the Dallas trimmed mean, as I mentioned.   So trimmed mean\u2014it cuts off the big movements on the upside and the downside and looks at just the mean movements in inflation of various product categories and service categories , and it didn\u2019 t go down at all.  It\u2019s at 2 percent \u2014or it\u2019s at, I don\u2019 t know whether it went down  or was above that , but it \u2019s at 2 percent now.  So there \u2019s reason to think that these will be transient. We, of course, will be watching very carefully to see that that is the case.   I would point to the case of cell phone  services.  Many of you wil l remember , in March of 2017, there was a\n\nMay 1, 2019     Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nvery low reading for cell phone services \u2014mobile phone services \u2014and it was kind of a price war, and it dragged down core inflation for a full year , but it did not look like something that would be repeated.  And we kind of thought so and said so, and then, sure enough, in 2018, we had those months of 2 percent inflation. So, again, we\u2019 ll have to see here.   We \u2019re going to be watching \u2014really, I \u2019d like to say we\u2019re going to be watching inflation carefully to see that t hese things are transient , and I \u2019ll end by saying we are strongly committed to the 2 percent inflation objective. NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  Just following up, Chair  Powell .  Nancy Marshall - Genzer with Marketplace.  You were saying if inflation does stay low  and these low inflation rates are not transient, you said a couple times you \u2019ll take that into account with monetary policy. How, specifically, will you take that into account? CHAIR POWELL.  Ye s, it\u2019s hard to say , because there\u2019 s so many other variable s. Ultimately, there are many variables to be taken into account at any given time , but that \u2019s part of our mandate.  Stable prices is half of our mandate , and we \u2019ve defined that as 2 percent .  So we woul d be concerned, and we\u2019 d take it into account. NAN CY MARSHALL -GENZER.  So a cut in interest rates would be possible? CHAIR POWELL.   I can \u2019t really be any more specific than what I \u2019ve said. JEAN YUNG.  Hi, Jean Yung with Market  News.  If the fed funds rate keeps rising, do you see room for another IOER adjustment?  And then, can you speak to any other strategies or tools that might be useful for keeping a ceiling on short -term interest rates?  There have been other ideas floated , like the standing repo facility and targeting a different benchmark rate.\n\nMay 1, 2019     Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nCHA IR POWELL.   If we need to , and as needed , we will use our tools to keep the federal funds rate somewhere in the target range.  We\u2019ll do that.  Don \u2019t expect to need to do it again , but we don\u2019 t know. I mean, we\u2019re \u2014with\u2014the balance sheet is now \u2014the size of it is going to be driven by demand for liabilities, principally reserves, as I mentioned.  And we \u2019re right at that point where we\u2019re starting to learn more and more about what the real demand for reserves is over the next few months.  And so I\u2014there is no template for this.  There\u2019 s no roadmap.  We just have to do it , and that \u2019s why we \u2019re moving so very gradually.  It\u2019s why we tapered the roll -off to only $15 billion in T reasuries per month.  Effective, I guess, today, we \u2019re cutting the roll- off rate for Treasuries in half just because we want to take our time and move gradually here.  So that \u2019s that. In terms of other tools, we \u2019re actually \u2014I\u2019m sure at an upcoming meeting we will be looking at the idea of a repo facility.  I don\u2019 t have any presu pposition that it \u2019s something we would do, but we \u2019ll be taking a look at it as a possible addition to our toolbox.  Again, I wouldn\u2019 t say\u2014it would just be a way for us to do what we do, which is to do a deep dive on it, think carefully about it, look at the pros and cons, look at the different possible ways to do it, and then go away and think about it for a little while.  And then probably come back and make a decision. But that \u2019s something we \u2019ll do at an upcoming meeting, I would imagine. HANNAH LANG.  Hannah Lang, American Banker.   On the regulatory side, the F ed and other bank regulators are said to be weighing all options for retooling  a proposal to revise the Volcker r ule.  Can you give any indication how close the agencies are to coming to a solution and what that solution might look like, whether it would be starting from scratch entirely or making changes to the original proposal?\n\nMay 1, 2019     Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nCHAIR POWELL.  You know , we put out a proposal on Volcker some time ago, and we got a lot of comments , and we\u2019 re reviewing them carefully.   I really don \u2019t have a lot for you.  I know they \u2019re making good progress.  I don\u2019 t really have a date though.  And in terms of what all it\u2019s going to be, it \u2019s not something I can say with any certainty yet. BRIAN CHEUNG.  Hi there. Brian Cheung with Yahoo Finance.  So given what you \u2019ve said about the expectations for consumption and also business fixed investment perhaps bouncing back in the next GDP reading, I \u2019m wondering if you think that continued growth in economic activity might show some sort of underlying fundamental that could flag another overheating.   For example, the median projection in the March meeting for GDP growth for 2019 was 2.1, so I \u2019m just kind of curious about what you see going forward if we continue to see strong GDP numbers. CHAIR POWELL.  Well, we don\u2019 t see any evidence at all of overheating, for one thing. We see inflation below 2 percent now \u2014as I mentioned, pretty close to 2 percent for most of last year.  So, really, no signs of overheating. If you look at the labor market, for a long time now there have been anecdotal reports of labor shortages and difficulty in finding skilled labor and that kind of thing.  Nonetheless, you have very strong job creation, and you have wages moving up at a rate that is appropriate , given inflation and given productivity , but not at all signaling any overheating at all.  It\u2019s not higher than that rate that would incorporate both inflation and productivity .  So, really not seeing signs of overheating at the moment. HEATHER LONG.  Are wages ever going to get back above 4 percent in this cycle? Can you kind of give us a read on\u2014but more substantively, can you give us a read on how the Committee views productivity growth, if it\u2019 s accelerating enough?\n\nMay 1, 2019     Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nCHAIR POWELL.  Ye s\u2014in terms of wages getting over 4 percent, wages have moved up pretty steadily over the last five years and are now \u2014wages and ben efits are now b etween 3 and 3\u00bd percent.  Just for the last couple of years, the biggest part of the gains have come for people at the lowest end of compensation and education, which is kind of a welcome thing. You mentioned productivity.  So productivity is really very difficult to predict.   No one has been able to predict it successfully, so I won\u2019 t really try.  But I will say this :  Productivity was very, very low in the wake of the crisis for six or seven years.  Last year, we had 1.9 percent productivity, which is much higher.  I don \u2019t know if that level can be sustained , but we really \u2014 it\u2019s driven, to some extent , by technological developments and, really , the diffusion of technology through the economy , and it \u2019s very hard to predict.  So I think it \u2019s positive. In fact, I\u2019ll mention, if we \u2019re talking about the supply side, labor force participation. Really , there has been a significant positive supply -side development over the last year  and a half between the uptick in labor force participation, which goes back several years, but also productivity.  And that does suggest more room to grow.  It suggests that a less tight economy , a less, you know \u2014may be part of the explanation for lower inflatio n. Thanks very much."

My colleagues and I have one overarching goal:  to sustain the economic expansion, with a strong job market and stable prices, for the benefit of the American people. At the FOMC meeting that concluded today, we maintained our policy interest rate but made some significant changes to our statement.  Since the beginning of the year, we have judged that our current policy stance was broadly appropriate and that we should be patient in assessing the need for any changes.  In light of increased uncertainties and muted inflation pressures, we now emphasize  that the Committee will closely monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion with a strong labor market and inflation near its 2 percent objective. I\u2019d like to step back and review how the changing economic and financial picture brings us to today\u2019s decision.  So far this year, the economy has performed reasonably well, with solid fundamentals supporting continued growth and strong employment.  Inflation has been running some what below our objective, but we have expected it to pick up, supported by solid growth and a strong job market.  Along with this favorable picture, we have been mindful of some ongoing crosscurrents, including trade developments and concerns about global growth.  At the time of our last FOMC meeting, which ended on May 1, there was tentative evidence that these crosscurrents were moderating.  The latest data from China and Europe were encouraging, and there were reports of progress in trade negotiations wi th China.  Our continued patient stance seemed appropriate, and the Committee saw no strong case for adjusting our policy rate. In the weeks since our last meeting, the crosscurrents have reemerged.  Growth indicators from around the world have disappointe d, on net, raising concerns about the strength of the\n\nJune 19, 2019     Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nglobal economy.  Apparent progress on trade turned to greater uncertainty, and our contacts in business and agriculture report heightened concerns over trade developments.  These concerns may have contr ibuted to the drop in business confidence in some recent surveys and may be starting to show through to incoming data .  Risk sentiment in financial markets has deteriorated as well.  Against this back drop, inflation remains muted. While the baseline outlook remains favorable, the question is whether these uncertainties will continue to weigh on the outlook and thus call for additional monetary policy accommodation.  Many FOMC participants now see that the case for a somewhat more accommodative policy has st rengthened.  Let me explain the basis for this judgment, starting with th e outlook for jobs and growth. Participants see unemployment remaining low this year and next.  Monthly job gains in May were lower than expected, however, and , in light of recent developments , this bears watching.  Still, many labor market indicators remain strong.  Community, business, and labor leaders all tell us that the prospects for job seekers have seldom been better , and that this is true even for those who have traditionally struggled to find work.  Wages are rising, and this is particularly so for lower -paying jobs. Committee participants\u2019 growth projections from 2019 are little revised from March, with a central tendency of 2 percent to 2.2 percent, just above their estimate s of longer -run normal growth.  The growth projections for the year as a whole mask some important details about the composition of growth.  Annual growth will be boosted by the surprisingly strong first quarter, which had just been reported at the time of  the May FOMC meeting.  As I noted then, the unexpected strength was largely in net exports and inventories \u2014components that are not generally reliable indicators of ongoing momentum.  The more reliable drivers of growth in the\n\nJune 19, 2019     Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\neconomy are spending on consumption and business investment.  While consumption was weak in the first quarter, incoming data show that it has bounced back and is now running at a solid pace.  In contrast, the limited evidence available at this time suggests that growth in business fixed income has slowed in the second quarter.1  Moreover, manufacturing production has posted declines so far this year.  Thus, while the baseline outlook remains favorable, many FOMC participants cited the investment picture and weaker business sentiment  and the crosscurrents I mentioned earlier as supporting their judgment that the risk of less favorable outcomes has risen. After running close to our symmetric 2 percent objective for most of last year, inflation declined in the first quarter.  Data since th en show some pickup.  Participants broadly see inflation moving back up toward our 2 percent objective, but at a slower pace than had been expected.  The central tendency for 2019 core inflation, which omits volatile food and energy components , is between 1.7 and 1.8 percent. Setting aside short -term fluctuations, Committee participants expressed concerns about the pace of inflation\u2019s return to 2 percent.  Wages are rising, as noted above, but not at a pace that would provide much upward impetus to inflation.  Moreover, weaker global growth may continue to hold i nflation down around the world. We are firmly committed to our symmetric 2 percent inflation objective, and we are well aware that inflation weakness that persists even in a healthy economy could pre cipitate a difficult- to-arrest downward  drift in longer -run inflation expectations.  Because there are no definitive measures of inflation expectations, we must rely on imperfect proxies.  Market -based measures of inflation compensation have moved down since our May meeting , and some survey - based expectations measures are near the bottom of their historic ranges.  Combining these\n\n1 Chair Powell intended to say that growth in business fixed investment slowed in the second quarter.\n\nJune 19, 2019     Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nfactors with the risks to growth already noted, participants expressed concerns about a more sustained shortfall of inflation. Overall, our policy discussions focused on the appropriate response to the uncertain environment.  The projections of appropriate policy show that many participants believe that some cut in the federal funds rate will be appropriate in the scenario that they see as most likely. Though some parti cipants wrote down policy cuts and others did not, our deliberations made clear that a number of those who wrote down a flat rate path agree that the case for additional accommodation has strengthened since our May meeting.  This added accommodation would support economic activity and inflat ion\u2019s return to our objective. Uncertainties surrounding the baseline outlook have clearly risen since our last meeting. It is important, however, that monetary policy not overreact to any individual data point or short - term swing in sentiment.  Doing so would risk adding even more uncertainty to the outlook. Thus, my colleagues and I will be looking to see whether these uncertainties will continue to weigh on the outlook, a nd we will use our tools as appropriate to sus tain the expansion. Thank you. I will be pleased to take your questions. NICK TIMIRAOS.   Nick Timiraos, Wall Street Journal.  Chair Powell, did you consider a rate cut today ?  Specifically , was it one of the options \u2014the policy options in the Teal book? And is the Committee considering moving , given all the uncertainty you addressed , moving  its\u2014 changing its policy before the next meeting? CHAIR POWELL.  So the Committee had, you know, our usual long discussion of global and domestic economic and financial co nditions and then spent this morning talking about monetary policy.  And I came to the view that I expressed to you, which is that we \u2019re going to be monitoring \u2014monitoring the crosscurrents and the other items that we \u2019ve mentioned, but that\n\nJune 19, 2019     Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nwe\u2019d like to see  more going forward.  Particularly, we \u2019d like to see whether these risks co ntinue to weigh on the outlook. So, generally, as I mentioned, many on the Committee do see a strengthened case\u2014eight of those , a strengthen ed case for cutting rates.  Eight actuall y wrote down rate cuts .  A number of others see that the case ha s strengthened .  But the Committee wanted to see more, as I mentioned.  And I also mentioned that some of these \u2014some of these developments have been of quite recent vintage .  And so we do expect that we\u2019 ll be learning a lot more on all of these issues in the near term.  And that \u2019s our focus. NICK TIMIRAOS.  Do you think something could change before the next meeting? CHAIR POWELL.   I\u2019m sure that things will change before the next meeting.  I expect a full range of data and information on all of these issues that we are looking at.  I think we \u2019ll learn a great deal more about them .  And I think that \u2019s\u2014we think that that \u2019s the right way to move here.  Again, many of these developments happened , you know, part of the way through the last intermeeting period.  Only seven weeks ago, we had a great jobs report and came out of the last see\u2014we want to see and w e want to react to developments and trends that are sustained, that are genuine , and not react just to data points or just to changes in sentiment , which can be volatile. At the same time, we are \u2014we \u2019re quite mindful of the risks to the outlook and are pre pared to move and use our tools as needed t o sustain the expansion. STEVE LIESMAN.  Mr. Chairman, Steve Liesman, CNBC.  Could you walk us through your thinking about trade?  It was really the threat of tariffs against Mexico that caused at least the market  to become definitively banking , or\u2014pricing in rate cuts .  If, for example, there \u2019s a deal with China, does that take the possibil ity of rate cuts off the table?\n\nJune 19, 2019     Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nCHAIR POWELL.  Ye ah, so I would say that we \u2019re not looking at any one thing.  I guess I would start by agreeing with your premise that news about trade has been an important driver of sentiment in the intermeeting period.  But we \u2019re also looking at global growth.  It \u2019s really trade developments and concerns about globa l growth that are on our minds. So we \u2019re not exclusively focused on one event or one piece of data.  Risks seem to have grown.  In the meantime, we have incoming data in the United States that \u2019s been pretty good, particularly for the consumer :  Consumer spending is solid supported by, you know, a healthy job market, high levels of employment, wages going up.  We do see , though, some areas that we\u2019re looking at , such as , I mentioned, business fixed income.2  So\u2014also , the prolonged shortfall in inflation and perhaps job growth\u2014we don\u2019 t like to look at one job report .  We like to average over three or six months, but still that bears watching. So we \u2019ll be monitoring the implications of all of those developments for the U.S. economic outlook.  We expect to learn a good deal more , as I mentioned.  And we \u2019ll be asking the question whether those risks are going to continue to weigh on the outlook.  And then, in the end, we \u2019ll use our tools as appropriate to sustain this long expansion. HEATHER LONG.  Hi, Heather Long from the Washington Post.  Could you clarify what you would do if the President tweets or calls you to say he would like to demote you as Fed Chair? CHAIR POWELL.  I think the law is clear that I have a four -year term , and I fully intend to serve it. JEANNA SMIALEK.  Hi, Chair Powell.  I was hoping that \u2014this is Jeanna Smialek from the New York Times.   I was hoping that you could clarify for us a little bit how you \u2019re thinking\n\n2 Chair Powell intended to say \u201cbusiness fixed investment.\u201d\n\nJune 19, 2019     Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nabout the risks of waiting too long to cut rates versus the risks of cutting rates prematurely \u2014sort of, what the balance of risks are and how you talk about that. CHAIR POWELL.  Right.  So we \u2019re always trying to balance that risk, but I would say that, given the quite recent nature of some of the events, I think the Committee felt , though, that the right thing to do was to wait and see more.  And we will see a lot more on all  of these issues in the very near term.  So I don \u2019t think the risk of waiting too long is prominent right now.  I would say , as a general matter, it \u2019s always something that we h ave to weigh.  But I think we believe that the right thing here is to watch carefully in the near term and see how these risks unfold and see whether they continue to weigh on the outlook. JEANNA SMIALEK.  [Inaudible] CHAIR POWELL.  Obviously , we try to av oid going prematurely as well.  In this case, you know, there \u2019s always some judgment in these things.  But I would just say that the risks that we see having emerged are risks that have gotten our attention and that have called a number of us to write down rate cuts , and a number of those who haven\u2019 t to see that the case has strengthened. MARTIN CRUTSINGER.  Marty Crutsinger with the AP.  You had your first dissent in your time as C hairman.  Does that give us a sense that there was debate among a group that  was pushing for a rate cut this time?  And how do you \u2014do you expect further dissents going forward? CHAIR POWELL.  Let me let me say the same thing as I said the last time , before there had been a ny dissents, a nd that is that I think the process of careful , thoughtful dissent is a very healthy one, and I \u2019ve always believed that .  And I feel like you make better decisions when you\n\nJune 19, 2019     Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nhear a disparity of views .  So I really do look at it that way.  I would add, though, that the support for the path we took for the policy statement that we adopted was quite broad. JAMES POLITI.  James Politi with the Financial Times.  Mario Draghi at the ECB yesterday sent a strong signal of new stimulus for the euro zone .  Do you think that such actions to ease policy at other central banks around the world will put more pres sure on the Fed to do the same? CHAIR POWELL.  Well, first, I think all central banks are focused on their domestic \u2014 their mandates are domestic , and they \u2019re focused on economic conditions from a domesti c standpoint.  And that goes for the European Central Bank, it goes for the Fed, it goes for all central banks .  So that \u2019s our principal focus.  So it could cut either way.  You know, I would think that , to the extent you see stronger financial conditions and stronger activity in the ECB after a rate cut, that would support \u2014tend to support activity.3  So we \u2019re really focused on, you know, the risks to our \u2014on the baseline outlook, which is still a pretty favorable one, and the risks to those outlooks.  That \u2019s our principal focus. HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Thanks.  This is the first time that you \u2019ve been really issuing SEPs in an era when rates are going to be going down.  Just two sort of related question s:  Is there concern that you \u2019ll be causing a sort of \u201c dot deflation \u201d by telling people, \u201cW ell, don\u2019 t buy your car now , because it \u2019ll get cheaper in six months because we\u2019 re cutting rates, \u201d and that that could sort of fulfill itself ?  And , secondly, on inflation, that was a pretty big drop in expected PCE, yet, you know, without reacting to it, are you not sort of undermining your own credibility in terms of commitment to the 2 percent target?\n\n3 Chair Powell intended to say \u201cstronger activity in the euro area.\u201d\n\nJune 19, 2019     Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nCHAIR POWELL.   I\u2019ll take th e inflation one first.  I didn\u2019 t quite follow your \u201c dot\u201d question. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. Well , the fact that expected inflation went from 1.8 to\u2014 Howard Schneider with Reuters \u2014went from 1.8 to 1.5, it \u2019s the fact that you \u2019re not responding to that. CHAIR POWELL.  That \u2019s the inflation question. HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Yes. CHAIR POWELL.  I\u2019m saying you \u2014 HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  On de f\u2014no, the fact that you \u2019ve signaled rate cuts are coming .  Or is\u2014was there any concern on the Committee that this would tell consumers, tell people , \u201cDon\u2019t borrow now, don\u2019 t spend now , because rates will get cheaper later \u201d? CHAIR POWELL.  I see.  Okay , right.  Okay .  So let me let me answer the inflation question first.  So we \u2019re saying that we know \u2014I noted in the statement and also in my \u2014what I said here.  We saw that market -based measures of inflation expectations, breakevens , dropped. We noted that also in the statement.  And I noted it as a reason for us to \u2014one of several reasons why it feels to us that the case for more accommodation has strengthened.  So we find that notable.  Not only that, the actual forecast for inflation for this  year, among FOMC participants , dropped a couple of tenths.  So that means a more prolonged shortfall of inflation. Let me say , on inflation, it \u2019s something I \u2019ve been concerned about for quite a long time. It\u2019s one of the principal reasons why I called fo r the review .  In a world where policy rates are going to be closer to the effective lower bound, t hen, just as a general matter, we need to be really strong on 2 percent inflation.  So I think, you know, we certainly don \u2019t want to be seen as weak on infla tion, and I don't believe we are.\n\nJune 19, 2019     Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nIn terms of the dots, you\u2019 re right , this is the first time , I believe, we \u2019ve had \u2014we\u2019ve talk ed about cutting in the \u201c dot era. \u201d  I guess the dot era began in January 2012.  And, you know, we \u2019re working our way through it.  A nd I think it \u2019s just something we do.  You know  that my view on the dots is that they , overall , provide useful information for people , but that we need to do our absolute best to explain what they are and what they are not. Speaking of which, they are not a forecast of the group, they \u2019re not discussed or debated at the meeting, they \u2019re an input to policy more than an output of policy , and they \u2019re also only the most likely case.  So , in a situation where there \u2019s relatively high uncertainty, the re\u2019s the most likely case, but the second most likely case might only be a little bit less likely.  But that doesn \u2019t show up in the dot.  The dot is either one thing or it \u2019s another.  So I just would say that , if you pay too close attention to the dots, then you may lose sight of the larger picture. CHRISTOPHER CONDON.  Thank you.  Chris Condon, Bloomberg News.  Mr. Chairman, if and when the Committee decides to cut rates, I suspect there \u2019ll be a debate over whether to move by 25 or 50 basis points.  Indeed , there\u2019 s a pretty substantial body of academic literature arguing that a central bank close to the zero lower bound ought to act sooner and more aggressively than it otherwise would.  I\u2019m w ondering what you think of that prescription, and if you could spe nd a couple of minutes discussing the pros and cons of the 50  basis point cut and how you approach that question. CHAIR POWELL.  On the specific question of that , that \u2019s just something we haven \u2019t really engaged with yet , and it will depend very heavily on incoming data and the evolving risk\n\nJune 19, 2019     Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\npicture as we move forward.  So it would be \u2014so nothing I can say about that is specific to the near-term question that we face. More generally , though, the research you refer to essentially notes that , in a world where you are closer to the effective lower bound, i t\u2019s why \u2014research kind of shows this \u2014it\u2019 s wise to react , for example, to prevent a weakening from  turning into a prolonged weakening .  In other words, sort of , an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.  So  I think that is a valid way to think about policy in this era.  I don \u2019t know \u2014and it \u2019s always in the \u2014I think it \u2019s in the minds of policymakers, you know, during this era, because it \u2019s well understood to be correct.  Again, I don\u2019t know what that means in t erms of the size of a particular rate cut going forward.  That \u2019s going to depend heavily upon, you know, the actual data  and the evolving risk picture. DONNA BORAK.   Donna Borak with CNN.  Thanks , Chairman Powell.   Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has provided a proposal to revalue the U.S. dollar in order to address concerns about rising trade deficits .  The President himself has routinely complained about the strength of the U.S. dollar , saying i t has resulted in , quote, \u201ctremendous ,\u201d close quote, competitive advantage with countries like China and others.  Do you think that an overvalued dollar has been a drag on America\u2019s global competitiveness?  And would you support an intervent ion of some kind on this issue? CHAIR POWELL.  The U.S. Treasury has responsibility for exchange rate policy , not the Fed, and we don\u2019t comment , in that sense , on the level of the dollar.  We have the responsibility for maximum employment and stable prices, and we use ou r tools to achieve that.\n\nJune 19, 2019     Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nOf course, we do that through changing financial conditions , and one of those is the dollar, but we don\u2019t target the dollar.  It\u2019s just something that we don\u2019t do. In fact, central banks \u2014or, rather , nations , when they get together , routinely adopt a communique that says we will target our domestic , economic , and financial conditions and not our exchange rate in using monetary policy, and that includes the United States, that includes the G-20 communique that we adopted 10 days ago.  So I\u2019m not the right person to ask about that sort of dollar policy intervention. PAUL KIERNAN.  Thank you, Chairman Powell .  Paul Kiernan from Dow Jones.  If the most \u2014according to the dot plot, I mean \u2014if the most likely case is that you will have to cut rates in the next 18 months and given some of the concerns about, you know, policy needing to react sooner and more aggressively, what would have been the downsides to cutting rates now?  Why not just cut them now? CHAIR POWELL.  So, why not now?  And, I would say , there was not much support for cutting rates now at this meeting.  There was, as you see, a number of people wrote down rate cuts.  But all of those , but apparently one , felt that it would be better to see more to \u2014before moving.  And I gave a co uple of reasons why that is the case.  First , it\u2019s just the fact that some of these developments are so recent that we want to see whether they\u2019ll sustain.  So we felt that it would be better to get a clearer picture of things, and that we would , in fact , learn a lot about these developments in the near term.  Ultimately, the question we\u2019re going to be asking ourselves is, are these risks going to be continuing to weigh on the outlook?  And we will act as needed, including promptly , if that\u2019s appropriate , and use our tools to expand\u2014to sustain the expansion. EDWARD LAWRENCE.   Yes.  Thank you for doing this, Chairman.  Edward Lawrence from Fox Business Network.  How do you reconcile the conflicting economic data coming in?\n\nJune 19, 2019     Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nYou know, on one hand, you have str ong overall growth.  C onsumer spending is strong.  On the other hand, manufacturing numbers were a little bit weaker, you have growth in  jobs but coming in a little weaker, and then you have low inflation.  And then, specifically, what data are you looking  at that you decided not to have a rate cut?  Why didn\u2019t you do that?  [0:24:15.5] CHAIR POWELL.   Well, you gave a pretty good picture.  I mean, it\u2019s a complicated picture , and , you know , the answer is , we look at all of it.  But I would say , the big pieces of it are this :  The baseline outlook has been a good one, and that has basically been consumer spending coming back up in the second quarter .  That is coming true.  And consumer spending is at a healthy level , and that makes sense.  You\u2019ve  got a tight labor market.  You\u2019ve got companies in surveys saying that labor is scarce.  You\u2019ve got workers in surveys saying that jobs are plentiful.  You\u2019ve got wages going up.  You\u2019ve got high levels of  household confidence.  So, all of that , underlyin g fundamentals for the consumer spending part of the economy , which is 70 percent of the economy , is quite solid.  Job creation, if you take a three -month average , is still well above, you know, the entry \u2014level of entry into the workforce.  So that part of  the economy is solid. You mentioned manufacturing , and we\u2019re seeing this all around the world. Manufacturing, investment, and trade have been weaker.  It\u2019s not solely a domestic issue , and it may be that there are a range of factors that are contributing  to that, including, for example, what China has done over the last couple of years in working to bring down its leverage.  Some of it may be uncertainty over your supply chains due to trade developments.  The Boeing 737 issues may be contributing in their  own way .  So the re\u2014lower oil prices are contributing to lower investment , although they\u2019re also leading to lower gas prices , which support s spending.  So there are many, many things.  There isn\u2019t any one thing that explains it all.  But it\u2019s something tha t\n\nJune 19, 2019     Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nwe\u2019re watching.  But you do see growth in services, so you\u2014this pattern around the world of weak manufacturing but growth in the far larger part of the services economy, which has led to low unemployment, good job creation, rising wages, that\u2019s kind of t he two big pieces of it that you see. Then you see the crosscurrents .  If you lay the crosscurrents on top of that \u2014concerns about global growth and trade developments \u2014you have the full picture.  And I think what that picture \u2014what we took away from that pic ture is that we\u2019d like to see more, that we do see these risks , and what we want to do is , we want  to watch and see whether they continue to weigh upon the outlook. MICHAEL MCKEE.  Michael McKee, Bloomberg Television and R adio.  If consumer spending is solid and business investment has been slowed by uncertainty, I\u2019d like to get your thinking on what a Fed rate cut would do?  Have you modeled the additional growth and inflation you might get from a rate cut?  Can you identi fy any sectors that would benefit from a lower cost of capital ?  Or is this really about the Fed being the only game in town? CHAIR POWELL.  Well, we have the tools we have , and we\u2019re committed and sworn to use them to support economic activity .  And they do support economic activity through a number of channels that are reasonably well understood\u2014 some more directly tied to interest rates than others.  But we do generally believe that \u2014that our interest rate policy can support demand and support business investment as well.  And so we will use those tools and use them as we see as appropriate to achieve our objective s, which really are to sustain this expansion, and I would just make a note of that. The reason why we say \u201c sustain the expansion\u201d  is, you\u2019re see ing now , for the first time, you know, communities that are being brought into the benefits of this expansion that hadn\u2019t\n\nJune 19, 2019     Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nbeen earlier.  You\u2019re 10 years deep into this , and that\u2019s something we heard quite a lot at the conference in Chicago on the review .  And I just would say , that\u2019s why we think \u2014it\u2019s one of the reasons why we think it\u2019s so important to sustain the expansion, keep it going, because we really are benefiting groups that haven\u2019t seen, you know, this kind of prosperity in a long time. MICHAEL M CKEE.   But g iven your description of the crosscurrents, do you think Fed policy can solve those problems? CHAIR POWELL.  So we take the\u2014 you know , we take the crosscurrents as a given , and we have our tools.  You know, we don\u2019t \u2014we react to anything in princ iple that could undermine our achievement of our dual -mandate goals \u2014maximum employment, stable prices \u2014is worthy of our attention and can call forth a policy response.  And that\u2019s just how we look at it. VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi, Victoria Guida with Politico.  Y ou\u2019ve said that the Fed doesn\u2019t take short -term political considerations into account, and you\u2019ve defended the Fed\u2019 s independence.  So I was wondering, is there a point at which you think that , publicly or privately , you should push back on the President\u2019s  criticisms rather than ignoring him?   And also, do you think that you and the President have the same goals when it comes to monetary policy? CHAIR POWELL.  You know , I don\u2019t \u2014I don\u2019t discuss elected officials publicly or privately , really .  So I would just say that we are \u2014at the Fed , we\u2019re deeply committed to carrying out our mission, a nd also that our independence from direct political control we see as an important institutional feature that has served both the economy and the country well. NANCY MARS HALL -GENZER.  Nancy Marshall -Genzer with Marketplace.  Chair Powell, are you concerned that new digital currencies like Libra, which Facebook unveiled this\n\nJune 19, 2019     Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nweek , could undermine the Fed and erode your power to influence the economy?  And did anyone from Fa cebook talk with anyone at the Fed before Libra was unveiled this week? CHAIR POWELL.   So, on your specific question of digital currencies replacing central bank currencies, I think we\u2019re a long way from that.  And, of course , the\u2014so I think we\u2019re a long way from that.  Digital currencies are in their infancy.  So, essentially, not too concerned about, you know, the central banks no longer being able to carry out monetary policy because of cryptocurrencies or digital currencies. You know, Facebook, I believ e, has made quite broad rounds in \u2014around the world really with regulator s, supervisors , and lots of people to discuss their plans , and that certainly includes us.  And we\u2019re \u2014you know, it\u2019s something we\u2019re looking at.  We meet with a broad range of private -sector firms all the time on financial technology , and there\u2019s just a tremendous amount of innovation going on out there.  You know, there are potential benefits here .  There are also potential risks , particularly of a currency that could, you know, that c ould potentially have large application.  So I would echo what Governor Carney said, which is that we will wind up having quite high expectations , from a sort of safety and soundness and regulatory standpoint, if they do decide to go forward with something . NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  Do you think the Fed will be  involved in regulating Libra then? CHAIR POWELL.  You know, we have \u2014we don\u2019t have plenary authority over cryptocurrencies as such.  They play into our world through consumer protection and money launde ring and things like that.  But , I would say that, you know, through international forums, you know, we have significant input into the payment system  and, as you know , play an important role in the payment system here in the United States.\n\nJune 19, 2019     Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nGREG ROBB.  Tha nk you, Chairman Powell.  Greg Robb from MarketWatch.  I want to take you back to Chicago and the review of your monetary policy strategy.  And something interesting, I think, is developing , is that outside experts are excited and  are\u2014like the idea of the Fed shifting your inflation target up to 4 percent \u2014around there , roughly , I guess.  They think that that would, you know, help monetary policy , and that there \u2019s no\u20142 percent is not , like , sanctimonious or anything , or whatever , sacred.  It seems that you \u2019ve taken that off the table.  So I was wondering if you could discuss that .  Have you taken it off the table ?  And then, if so , why , or\u2014and what \u2019s your thoughts on that ?  Thank you. CHAIR POWELL.   We have\u2014we\u2019ve said that we wouldn\u2019 t look at raising the tar get rate for inflation.  We did say that.  And the reason is , it\u2019s become a global norm , 2 percent .  Our statutory mandate is price stability.  And so we \u2019re actually taking a less \u2014we\u2019re looking at less radical ideas , such as how to make the 2 percent infla tion objective more credible. This gives me a chance to say a couple things about the review and Chicago, in particular.  So it \u2019s a new thing for us .  It\u2019s something that \u2014I thought it was both appropriate and important for us to do.  It \u2019ll be a yearlong , or even longer , process , looking at our strategy , tools , and communications.  And it \u2019s meant to be a way to open ourselves up, to let the sunshine in, and have dialogue and criticism with the constituencies that we serve.  We \u2019ve had a series of Fed Listens  around the country at every Reserve Bank,  and we had an academic conference earlier this month , with seven papers written and criticized , and leading global experts. But I \u2019ll just say , again , that the heart of the conference was the two panels on \u2014with practitioners in low and moderate income \u2014who live in low - and moderate -income communities and are part of those communities.  And they were \u2014there, I think, people were quite struck by their intervention, which was really uniformly around how important maximum  employment is\n\nJune 19, 2019     Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nand what it means in their communities.  You know, the idea being , they haven \u2019t had, you know, a bull market in these communities.  They haven \u2019t had , just , a booming economy.  What they have had is low unemployment, lots of social problems.  And just now , you have, you know, companies who want to hire and are bringing people into the \u2014providing opportunities for people to come into the labor force to an extent not seen in quite a long time. And that is , I think, you know, for someone who does this work, that was very focusing and motivating , too.  So I think everybody thought, you know, that \u2019s\u2014that was really quite worth doing.  I mean, there was some thought at the beginning that we should\u2014s ome people recommended that we just talk to, you know , econ Ph .D.\u2019s about this, but , no, that \u2019s not what we chose to do, and we \u2019re glad this is the choice we made. GREG ROBB.  But even those two panels that you just referenced, the people that spoke, they\u2014when they were asked about, you know, 2 percent inflation or higher inflation, they kind of shrugged their shoulders, you know?  So\u2014is 4 percent inflation radical ?  And to who? CHAIR POWELL.   I don \u2019t think it\u2019 s\u2014I don\u2019 t think it\u2019 s a practical alternative.  And I \u2019ll tell you why.  I think you see disinflationary pressures around the world.  You see central banks having a hard time getting inflation up to their \u2014close to their objective.  We \u2019ve done better than other large central banks that are not, you know, open e conomies , like the U.K., where you have big currency moves that move inflation around.  So\u2014but it \u2019s quite challenging to get inflation \u2014 it\u2019s been \u2014even with very high level s of resource utilization, inflation has been lingering and not getting back up to tar get in  a sustained , symmetric kind of a way.  So saying that you\u2019 re going to go for 4 percent \u2014I wonder how credible that will be. JOHN HELTMAN.   John Heltman with American Banker.   I have a question about the Fed\u2019s\u2014or, I guess , the b ank r egulators \u2019 leverag ed lending guidance from 2013.  As you know,\n\nJune 19, 2019     Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nthe GAO had a letter saying that they thought it was a rule , and it sort of went away.  But yet leveraged lending is a source of concern .  You yourself have said that credit  underwriting quality seems to be deteriorating somewhat lately , and that the Fed has tools to supervise banks and to prevent leverage d lending from becoming too much of an issue.  I want to know what the \u2014is the 2013 guidance still representative of the , sort of , Fed\u2019s thinking about lever aged lending?  And does the Fed have any intent \u2014intention to either issue , like , a leveraged lending rule or a new guidance that is less problematic ?  Or is the plan to just kind of carry on with supervision as you\u2019re\u2014as you  are? CHAIR POWELL.  So the 2013 guidance is not binding , and that \u2019s what came out of the GAO review.  But that \u2019s really the beginning of this \u2014of the story.  You know, we have the authority we need to examine the banks for safety and soundness exposure.  So, this \u2014the first thing you star t with as a bank supervisor is the risks that the banks are taking to themselves through their portfolio, through the risks that they \u2019re running and the pipeline \u2014you know, the obligations that they \u2019ve undertaken to underwrite deals.  And so we monitor that  very carefully \u2014so do the banks \u2014and you see exposures that are much smaller than they were before the crisis.  And, by the way, we test that regularly in the stress tests .  We impose very large losses on those portfolios, so we kind of have a sense of what  that is , whereas before the crisis, there was a lot of lack of knowledge about what the losses would be.  So that \u2019s where it starts for us in supervision, is the risks that the banks are running \u2014you know, running on their own books and to themselves and t o each other.  So, in that, I feel \u2014I feel like that is \u2014that\u2019s in a good place , but we never \u2014we never  say \u201cMission accomplished\u201d  on that.  We will keep\u2014 you know, keep monitoring that carefully.\n\nJune 19, 2019     Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nWhat \u2019s happened, though, is , the paper  is now owned by market -based vehicles : collateralized loan obligations, mutual funds , and things like that.  And so we now have \u2014you know, we have a good sense of , domestically , of where that paper is.  I think, internationally , not as much , and the Financial S tability Board is actually looking more carefully at that.  And we \u2014 you know, we monitor those vehicles to see what they are.  And they \u2019re actually pretty stably funded, in the  sense that there\u2019 s no run risk, but  there\u2019 s still macroeconomic risk.  And, y ou know, this is something that we take very seriously and that the FSOC, the Financial Stability Oversight Council , is looking at.  And, you know, we call it out as a macroeconomic risk, but it \u2019s not really a financial stability risk , in the sense that it could undermine the ability of the financial system to do its job of intermediating credit. JOHN HELTMAN.  Is there any intention , is there any plan on the part of the Fed or other regulators to sort of create any additional clarity for , or\u2014and  consistenc y, really \u2014that\u2019s the other point of guidance, right ?\u2014is to make sure everyone knows kind of what the supervisory  expectations are for leveraged lending and for all \u2014for anything , for that matter.  Is anything else coming?  Or is it just going to  remain kind of , like , bilateral kind of conversations with banks? CHAIR POWELL. You know, I think the issue isn\u2019 t that the banks don\u2019 t understand what the rules are.  The issue is that the risk isn \u2019t in the banks.  It \u2019s in\u2014it\u2019s out in those market -based vehicles.  So  I don\u2019 t, I don\u2019t \u2014you know, I no longer am day -to-day involved in this as I was before I took this job.  But my sense is , though, that that\u2019 s really not the problem.  I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s perfect , but I think we do understand what risks the banks are runnin g.  And really the question is, how concerned should we be about large holdings by market -based vehicles that I mentioned, and what risks do they present ?  And we \u2019re very carefully assessing that.  And we\n\nJune 19, 2019     Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\ncontinue to take all these risks seriously.  You know, I gave a whole speech about this a few weeks ago, so. BRIAN CHEUNG.   Hi.  Brian Cheung with Yahoo Finance.  I \u2019m just wondering if you could expand a little bit on the labor market.  So the statement noted that the labor market still remains strong , but the May jobs report  that that we saw missed on estimates , but employment rates still stayed at 3.6 percent.  I \u2019m wondering how you reconcile that with the fact that we only got 3.1 percent year-over-year wage growth in that report.  What does that tell you about employment, and by all standards compared to, say , a month ago or a year ago, are we closer or farther away from full employment or maximum employment? CHAIR POWELL.  You know , we have to be closer , because more jobs are being created than people a re entering the labor force.  The unemployment rate is lower.  You know, by just lots and lots of numbers, the labor market is in a good place.  You mentioned wages .  So the level of wages is very consistent with what it should be , in the  sense that it \u2019s approximately equal to inflation plus productivity increases on an hourly basis.  So what \u2019s, I guess , a little surprising , though, is that you could reach these levels of unemployment late \u2014you know, long into a cycle, let\u2019s say , and not see even higher wages  that are pushing up on inflation, because wages at this level, even though they \u2019re growing at a healthy rate, at an appropriate rate, they \u2019re not growing at a rate that would provide much upward thrust for inflation. So, you know, we watch \u2014we watch  all of this very carefully , and I think we \u2019re very careful about not assuming that we \u2019re, you know, that would\u2014that there \u2019s no more slack in the labor market.  You know, we \u2019ve all lived through \u2014you know, when I got to the Fed, we we re in the 8 percent \u2013plus range , and it \u2019s just gone down and down and down, and you haven\u2019 t seen wages picked up.  You haven\u2019 t seen real signals that we\u2019re at maximum employment.  You have\n\nJune 19, 2019     Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nseen a tightening labor market.  You know, it \u2014the surveys that  I men tioned will all show that the labor market has  tightened , but not overtightened. JEAN YUNG.   Hi, Jean Yung with Market News.  I wanted to ask\u2014did the FOMC discuss a  change to its balance sheet policy at this meeting , perhaps ending runoffs earlier than planned?  And would the Committee be inclined to do something like that if it lowers rates before September? CHAIR POWELL.  So, of course, we haven\u2019t made any decisions yet.  Balance sheet runoff is very close to the end of its planned life.  I would say this :  If we do provide more accommodation \u2014again, we haven\u2019t really addressed this \u2014but if  we do provide more accommodation, we\u2019ll certainly keep in mind what we said earl ier this year , which is that we\u2019ll always be willing to adjust balance sheet policy so tha t it serves our dual -mandate objectives. Thank you very much."

We decided today to lower the target for the federal funds rate by \u00bc percentage point to a range of 2 percent to 2 \u00bc percent.   The outlook for the U.S. economy remains favorable , and this action is designed to support that outlook.  It is intended to insure against downside risks from weak global growth and trade policy uncertainty , to help offset the effects these factors are currently having on the  economy , and to promote a faster return of inflation to our symmetric 2 percent objective.  All of these objectives will support achievement of our overarching goal:  to sustain the expansion, with a strong job market and inflation close to our objective , for the benefit of the American people. We also decided to conclude the runoff of our securities portfolio in August rather than in September , as previously planned.  And I \u2019ll discuss the thinking behind today\u2019s interest rate reduction and then turn to t he path forward. As the year began, both the economy and monetary policy were in a good place.  The unemployment rate was below 4 percent, and inflation had been running near our 2 percent objective for nine months.  Our interest rate target was at the low  end of estimates of neutral. Over the first half of the year, the economy grew at a healthy pace and job gains pushed unemployment to near a half -century low.  Wages have been rising, particularly for lower -paying jobs.  People who live and work in low - and middle -income communities tell us that many who have struggled to find work are now getting opportunities to add new and better chapters to their lives.  This underscores for us the importance of sustaining the expansion so that the strong job market r eaches more of those left behind.\n\nJuly 31, 2019    Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nThrough the course of the year, weak global growth, trade policy uncertainty, and muted inflation have prompted the FOMC to adjust its assessment of the appropriate path of interest rates.  The Committee moved from expecting rate increases this year to a patient stance about any changes and then to today\u2019s action.  The median Committee participant\u2019s assessments of the neutral rate of interest and the longer -run normal rate of unemployment have also declined this year, reinf orcing the case for a somewhat lower path for our policy rate.  These changes in the anticipated path of interest rates have eased financial conditions and have supported the economy. At our June meeting, many Committee participants saw that the case for lowering the federal funds rate had strengthened, but the Committee wanted to get a better sense of the overall direction of events.  Since then, we have seen both positive and negative developments.  Job growth was strong in June and, looking through month- to-month fluctuations, the data point to continued strength.  We expect job growth to be slower than last year but above what we believe is required to hold the unemployment rate steady. GDP growth in the second quarter came in close to expectations.  Consumption\u2014 supported by rising incomes and high household confidence \u2014is the main engine driving the economy forward.  But manufacturing output has declined for two consecutive quarters, and business fixed investment fell in the second quarter.  Foreign growt h has disappointed, particularly in manufacturing and notably in the euro area and China.  In response to this weakness, many central banks around the world are increasing policy accommodation or contemplating doing so.  After simmering early in the year, trade policy tensions nearly boiled over in May and June but now appear to have returned to a simmer.  Looking through this\n\nJuly 31, 2019    Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nvariability, our business contacts tell us that the ongoing uncertainty is making some companies more cautious about their capital s pending. The domestic inflation shortfall has continued.  Core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices and is a better gauge of future developments than is total inflation, has run at 1.6 percent over the past 12 months.  We continue to expect tha t inflation will return over time to 2 percent.  But domestic inflation pressures remain muted, and global disinflationary pressures persist.  Wages are rising, but not at a pace that would put much upward pressure on inflation. We are mindful that inflation\u2019s return to 2 percent may be further delayed, and that continued below -target inflation could lead to a worrisome and difficult -to-reverse downward slide in longer -term expectations. So taking all of that on board, the Committee still sees a favorable baseline outlook. Over the year, however, incoming information on global growth, trade policy uncertainty, and muted inflation have led the Committee to gradually lower its assessments of the path of policy interest rate that would best support that outlook.  Today, we judg e that those factors warrant the policy adjustment I described :  \u201cAs the Committee contemplates the future path of the target range for the federal funds rate, it will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near its symmetric 2 percent objective.\u201d Thank you.  I am happy to take your questions. JEANNA SMIALEK.  Hi, Chair Powell .  Jeanna Smialek with the New York Times .  Per your statement here, I guess the question is, is there any reason to believe that a 25 basis point cut is going to be sufficient to expediently return inflation to your 2 percent target ?  And, if not,\n\nJuly 31, 2019    Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nwhat are you going to be looking at to convince y ou that you need to cut rates again?  What is the hurdle rate there? CHAIR POWELL .  So I think you have to look at not just the 25 ba sis point cut, but look at the C ommittee \u2019s actions over the course of the year .  As I noted in my opening statement, we started off expecting some rate increases , we moved to a patient setting for a few months, and now we \u2019ve moved here .  I think what you \u2019ve seen over the course of the year is , as we \u2019ve moved to a more accommodative policy, the economy has actually performed ju st about as expected with that gradually increasing support .  And I think\u2014 I wouldn\u2019 t take credit for all of that, but I do think that increasing policy support  has kept the economy on track and kept the outlook favorable . In terms of the rest of your quest ion, the C ommittee is really thinking of this as a way of adjusting policy to a somewhat more accommodative stance to further the three objectives that I mentioned:   to insure against downside risks, to provide support to the economy , that  those factors are \u2014where factors are pushing down on economic growth, and then to support inflation. So we do think it will serve all of those goals, but again, we \u2019re thinking of it as essentially in the nature of a midcycle adjustment to policy. MICHAEL MCKEE.  Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio.  There\u2019 s a perception out there  that perhaps , in this case , the F ed is something of a hammer in search of a nail, because the latest consumer spending reports, as you suggested, don\u2019 t seem to show any kind of demand problem in the U.S.  A nd when you look at mortgage rates, auto lending rates, they\u2019ve all come down .  And so, wondering exactly what problem lower capital costs will solve. CHAIR POWELL .  So, you\u2019 re absolutely right .  The \u2014the  performance  of the economy has been reasonably good.  The position of the economy is as close to our objectives as it \u2019s been\n\nJuly 31, 2019    Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nin a long time, and the outlook is also good.  What we\u2019 ve been monitoring since the beginning of the year is , effectively , downside risks to t hat outlook from weakening global growth, and we see that everywhere:   weak manufacturing, weak global growth now , particularly in the European Union and China .  In addition, we see trade policy developments, which at times have been disruptive and then ha ve been less so, and also inflation running below target .  So we see those as threats to what is clearly a favorable outlook, and we see this action as designed to support them and keep that outlook favorable .  And , frankly, it is a continuation of what we \u2019ve been doing all year to provide more support against those very same risks. MICHAEL  MCKEE .  But the follow -up question is, how does it  do that?  How does cutting interest rates lower \u2014or, how does cutting interest rates keep that going , since the cost of capital doesn \u2019t seem to be the issue here? CHAIR POWELL .  You know, I \u2014I really think it does , and I think the evidence of my eyes tells me that our policy does support \u2014it supports confidence, it supports economic activity, household and business confidence, and through channels that we understand.  So it will lower borrowing costs .  It will\u2014and it will work .  And I think you see it .  Since\u2014 you know, since we noted our vigilance about the situation in June, you saw financial conditions move up, and you saw\u2014I won \u2019t take credit for the whole recovery, but you saw financial conditions move up.  You see confidence, which had troughed in June \u2014you saw it move back up.  You see economic activity on a healthy basis .  It just\u2014it seems to work through confide nce channels as well as the mechanical channels that you are talking about. HEATHER LONG.  Hi, Heather Long from t he Washington Post .  You always say that the F ed is data dependent, and much of the data that we \u2019ve seen since the June meeting has surprised to the upside or at least been in line with expectations .  Can you give us a sense of how\n\nJuly 31, 2019    Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nthat better -than-expected data impacted the FOMC \u2019s thinking ?  And if we keep seeing these upside surprises, does that change or evolve any FOMC thinking going forward? CHAIR POWELL .  So, yes .  I mean , I think we \u2014of course, you know, what we do at every meeting, as I noted, is , we do a deep dive into U.S . economic activity and global activity and, certainly , carefully went through U.S . economic activity, which there has  been some positive and some negative, but , overall , the U.S . economy has shown resilience during the intermeeting period.  But, again, the \u2014the  issue is more the downside risks and then the shortfall in inflation, and we \u2019re trying to address those . So, in addition, going forward, I would say, we \u2019re going to be monitoring those same things .  We \u2019ll be monitoring the evolution of trade uncertainty, of global growth, and of low inflation .  And we \u2019ll also, of course, be watching the performance of the U.S . econo my.  As I mentioned, it had shown some resilience here to those issues, and we \u2019ll be putting all of that together , and that \u2019s how we \u2019ll be thinking about policy going forward. STEVE LIESMAN .  Steve Liesman , CNBC .  I just want to follow up on that .  Would you say we \u2019re sort of\u2014 you guys have gotten into a new regime here?  This is sort of an insurance cut and not a data -dependent cut ?  And are we now more in the realm of watching headlines of trade talks than we are watching unemployment rate and inflation numbers , or\u2014and growth numbers?  What \u2014how do we know what you\u2019 re going to do next , and why now in this new regime? CHAIR POWELL .  Ye s.  So I gave three reasons for what we did, and that is to i nsure against downside risks to the outlook from weak global growth and trade tensions .  So that is \u2014in a sense, that is a risk -management point, and that is a bit of insurance .  But we also feel like weak global growth and trade tensions are having an effect on the U.S . economy .  You see it\n\nJuly 31, 2019    Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nnow in the second quarter :  You see weak investment , you see weak manufacturing \u2014so support demand there  and also to support return of inflation to  2 percent .  But there \u2019s definitely an insurance aspect of it . Trade is unusual .  We don \u2019t\u2014you know, the thing is, there isn\u2019 t a lot of  experience in responding to global trade tensions .  So it is a \u2014it\u2019 s something that we haven\u2019 t faced before and that we \u2019re learning by doing .  And it is not \u2014it\u2019 s not exactly the same as watching global growth , where you see growth weakening, you see central banks and governments responding with fiscal policy, and you see growth strengthening, and you see a business cycle .  With trade tensions \u2014 which do seem to be having a significant effect on financial market conditions and on the economy \u2014they evolve in a different way, and we have to follow them . And, by the way, I want to be clear here.  We play no role whatsoever in assessing or evaluating trade policies other than as \u2014as trade policy uncertainty has an effect on the U.S . economy in the short and medium te rm.  We \u2019re not in any way criticizing trade policy .  That \u2019s really not our job. NICK TIMIRAOS .  Thank you.  Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal .  So, Chair Powell, you and your colleagues have offered three reasons to cut rates :  a lower neutral rate that may have made policy a little bit tighter than anticipated, the global slowdown and the darker risk picture from the trade tensions, and this desire to re -center inflation and inflation expectations .  I wonder, which of those fac tors, if any, weighs most heavily on you?  A nd, more importantly, is a \u00bc point cut really going to address all of that, let alone any one of those? CHAIR POWELL .  So I actually think different people have different \u2014different weightings has been my experien ce on those things .  You mentioned lower r* , trade slowdown\u2014 and I would actually add,  lower natural rate of unemployment too has moved down, all of which\n\nJuly 31, 2019    Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nkind of point to more accommodation.  So, again, I don \u2019t think asking about a \u00bc point is really the ri ght question.  I think you have to look back over the course of the year and see the Committee moving away from rate increases to a neutral posture to , now , a rate cut . So I think we \u2019ve been providing \u2014and that a ffects the forward rate path, and it affects financial conditions, and financial conditions affect the economy .  You see an economy which is actually performing pretty well .  Growth in the first half of this year is about the same as it was in all of \u2019 18 and actually a little better than our forecast  for growth in 2019 \u2014at the end of 2019. So I think, in a way , that \u2019s monetary policy working .  And , again, I wouldn \u2019t just look at the 25 basis point cut as the right question. NICK TIMIRAOS .  If I could follow up, I guess in May \u2014in May  it seemed as if you were setting a higher bar to cut rates :  There would need to be a deterioration i n the outlook.  In June, you seemed to suggest that if the outlook didn\u2019 t improve, there might be a rate cut .  Where is that bar right now , because I think there \u2019s some co nfusion about how the C ommittee is responding. CHAIR POWELL .  Ye s.  So we, as we noted \u2014we noted at the bottom of the statement that language, which really says how we \u2019re thinking about it .  So it says , as we\u2019re contemplating the future path of the target r ange for the federal funds rate, we \u2019ll continue to monitor the implications of incoming information \u2014and it talks  about that language .  So, you know, I can \u2019t\u2014 all I can tell you is, we \u2019ll be looking at weak global growth.  We \u2019ll be looking very carefully to see how that \u2019s happening. And I think you see \u2014you learn \u2014every cycle you learn about these things .  So we will see whether growth is picking up, whether it \u2019s bottoming out .  We \u2019ll see that picture .  We \u2019ll also see on trade.  Y ou know, we \u2019re going to be seeing \u2014I think we \u2019ve learned a lot on trade in this\n\nJuly 31, 2019    Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\ncycle .  I think we \u2019ll continue to learn more , and on inflation we will .  So, in addition, the U.S . economy itself is \u2014the performance of the U.S . economy will enter into that .  So I would love to be more p recise, but with trade , it is a factor that we have to assess in kind of a new way .  Those are the things that we \u2019ll be looking at, and\u2014 you know, in  making our decisions going forward. EDWARD LAWRENCE .  Edward Lawrence with Fox Business Network.  So a rate hike last December was seen by some economists and the St. Louis F ed president, James Bullard, as a step too far.  Now the F ed\u2019s waited about seven months for a rate cut .  You said today you were concerned about downside risks .  So could some of the weakn ess on the business side , with that fixed investment and the sluggish side on the business side , be because the F ed waited so long ?  I want to get your thoughts on that  and talk about why you feel that this nudge is the right level. CHAIR POWELL .  Ye s.  So we don\u2019 t hear that from businesses .  They don\u2019 t come in and say, \u201cWe\u2019re not investing because, you know, the federal funds rate is too high.\u201d   I haven \u2019t heard that from a business .  What you hear is that demand is weak for their products .  You see manufacturing being weak all over the world.  Investment \u2014business investment is weak.  A nd I wouldn\u2019 t lay all of that at the door of trade talks .  I think there \u2019s a\u2014there\u2019s a  global business cycle happening with manufacturing and investment, and that \u2019s\u2014tha t\u2019s been, you know, definitely a bigger factor than , certainly , we expected late last year .  I think global \u2014global growth started to slow down in the middle of last year, but that has gone on to a greater extent . And, by the way, trade policy uncertainty has also been, I think, more elevated than we antic ipated. In terms of , is this the \u2014we believe this is the right move for today, and we think it\u2019 s\u2014we think it will serve the three ends that I mentioned .  And I \u2019ve already gone over how we \u2019re thinking about going forward.\n\nJuly 31, 2019    Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nANN SAPHIR .  Ann Saphir  with Reuters.  You called it \u201c a midcycle adjustment to policy .\u201d  And, I mean, what should we take this to mean, and what message do you mean to send with this move today about future rate moves? CHAIR POWELL .  Well, the sense of that is \u2014I mean , that refers back to other times when the FOMC has cut rates in the middle of a cycle .  And I\u2019m contrasting it there with the beginning \u2014for example, the beginning of a lengthy cutting cycle. ANN SAPHIR .  So we\u2019re not at the beginning of a lengthy cutting cycle? CHAIR POWELL .  That is not \u2014that \u2019s not what we \u2019re seeing now .  That \u2019s not our perspective now or outlook. JAMES POLITI .  Hi there .  Are there any circumstances under which you would decide to pause \u2014pause  at one interest rate cut, today \u2019s interest rate cut , and not \u2014not , not go ahead with further monetary easing at this stage ?  Or are you predicting that, you know, once you\u2019 ve embarked on this easing , you will have to at least move by one more notch going f orward? CHAIR POWELL .  You know, so our policy is \u2014will depend on the implications of incoming data for the economic outlook as well as evolving risks to that outlook.  A nd so we \u2019re going to be monitoring the implications of incoming information for the out look, as I mentioned. And, s o I\u2014that \u2019s really where I would leave you with that. VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi .  Victoria Guida with Politico .  On capital, Vice Chairman Quarles has said that the level of capital requirements that exist s right now are such that it\u2019 s basically like the counter cyclical capital buffer is already turned on , and that he would like the ability to be able to turn it down in a downturn.  I was wondering if you agreed with that .\n\nJuly 31, 2019    Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nAnd then, also, just quickly , on real -time payments \u2014larger banks have suggested that if the F ed built its own system , that would be  a bait -and-switch , because the F ed asked \u2014or called for a private -sector system .  Do you think that that is a fair assessment? CHAIR POWELL .  Okay .  So, on the first, I would say that I view the level of capital requirements and the level of capital in the system as being about right .  I do agree with that . The idea that you \u2019re talking about is one that \u2019s\u2014that Vice Chair Quarles has talked about .  It\u2019s a\u2014it\u2019s one under consideration.  The idea being , in a sense , we\u2019ve chosen, in the United States, to have high through -the-cycle capital requirements by doubling the SIFI  surcharge, which is the surcharge that the largest banks have in their capital requirem ents.  We \u2019ve, in effect , already put in place substantial countercyclical buffers .  And so, conceptually , you can think of \u2014I\u2019m not saying it\u2019 s the same thing as a countercyclical capital buffer . So that \u2019s\u2014that\u2019s really the point \u2014is that we don\u2019 t rely \u2014our s ystem doesn \u2019t rely on our ability \u2014it doesn\u2019 t mainly rely on our ability to identify the right time in the cycle to trigger a countercyclical tool .  We rely on through- the-cycle, always -on high capital and liquidity requirements .  And I think that \u2019s a good thing to do.  The idea of putting it in place so you can cut it, that\u2019 s something some other jurisdictions have done, and it \u2019s worth considering .  I think the United Kingdom , in particular , has a  countercyclical capital buffer that\u2019 s always on , but the one point of it is that you can cut when there \u2019s a downturn and therefore give the banks more room .  So this isn \u2019t something we \u2019ve decided to do.  It\u2019s just under consideration. In terms of the real -time payment system, your second question, so this is something we\u2014the United States is far behind other countries in terms of having real -time payments available to the general public.  The F ed, really, coming out of the Reserve System \u2014the Reserve Banks and the Board together \u2014convened all of the stakeh olders around the table to talk about\n\nJuly 31, 2019    Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nhow we can move forward.  This is consumer groups, technology companies, banks, card companies \u2014pretty much all of the groups who would be interested\u2014and worked on a project for several years .  And one of the things tha t came out of that  was a recommendation that the Fed should build a 24 x  7 x 365 real-time settlement system to solve that problem\u2014to address that problem . We put out a proposal in October of last year about, you know, should we do this, and we got quite a  lot of comments .  They were overwhelmingly favorable .  And I would point out that in our payment system, in many places, the F ed operates alongside private -sector operators \u2014for example, in wholesale payments , in ACH, and in check\u2014so it wouldn\u2019 t be unusual  or out of keeping with \u2014with  how we \u2019ve done things in the past .  We have not made a decision on this, but it \u2019s something we \u2019re looking at carefully and something I do expect we \u2019ll make a decision on soon. CRAIG TORRES .  Craig Torres from Bloomberg .  I\u2019m trying to parse what you \u2019re saying here .  On the one hand, you say the policy tilt in the statement has eased financial conditions , and that \u2019s helping the economy .  In that tilt, market participants are interpreting this language , \u201cwill act as appropriate ,\u201d as still being in the statement.  And , on the other hand, you say it \u2019s not the start of a \u2014of an easing cycle.  So what are you saying?  Does that mean, you know, with one or two more cuts you\u2019 ll be done, and this policy bias comes out of the statement ? Or simply that this policy bias will come out of the statement sooner than market participants think? CHAIR POWELL .  So it is \u2014as I mentioned, it \u2019s going to depend on the evolving data and the evolving risk picture .  But as we look at the situation now and the outlook now, what we see is that it\u2019 s appropriate to make an adjustment in policy to a somewhat more accommodative\n\nJuly 31, 2019    Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nstance.  That \u2019s what we \u2019re seeing .  And that \u2019s what we \u2019re going to be looking \u2014you know, we \u2019ll be looking at incoming data, at all of the \u2014at the risks that I mentioned , and the performance of the U.S . economy , and at low  inflation .  We\u2019ll be looking at that to make our decisions going forward. SCOTT HORSLEY.  Thank you, Mr .  Chairman .  Scott Horsley for NPR .  You \u2019ve talked a number of times about the people who feel like they are just rece ntly getting to the punchbowl 10 years into this expansion.  Can you elaborate a little bit on how this rate cut is expected to help them? CHAIR POWELL .  Well, I think the best thing for people who are \u2014who a re feeling that\u2014and we are getting lots of feedback from people who work and live in low - and moderate - income communities to the effect that they \u2019re now feeling the recovery , and, in fact , they haven\u2019 t felt a better labor market in anybody \u2019s memory , so this is great to hear .  And I guess my view is , the best thing we can do for those people is to sustain the expansion, keep it going, and that \u2019s one of the overarching goals of \u2014of this move and all of our policy moves .  There really is no reason why the expan sion can \u2019t keep going .  Inflation is not troublingly high.  If you look at the \u2014at the U.S. economy right now, there \u2019s no sector that \u2019s booming and therefore might bust .  You have a fairly well -balanced, in a sense, economy . Now, the engine , though,  is real ly a consumer economy, which is 70 percent of the economy .  The manufacturing economy \u2014the investment and manufacturing part of the economy \u2014is more or less not \u2014not  growing much .  It\u2019s at a healthy level but not growing much . So\u2014and we hope to help that with this rate cut.  But, I would say , overall , we\u2019re trying to sustain the expansion and keep, you know, close to our statutory goals, which are maximum employment and stable prices.\n\nJuly 31, 2019    Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nDONNA BORAK.  Chairman Powell , Donna Borak with CNN.  The President has repeatedly called for this rate hike and for the Fed to end the runoff of its balance sheet.  What do you say to those that say that the Fed gave into what the President wanted today?  And could you also elaborate a little bit further on why the Fed decide d to speed up its balance sheet runoff two months earlier today? CHAIR POWELL.  So I gave my \u2014my reasons for \u2014our reasons , really \u2014for doing this . And, you know, just to touch on that again, this action is designed to i nsure against downside risks to the out look from weak global growth and trade tensions, offset the negative effect that those factors are already having, and promote a faster return  of inflation to  2 percent.  That\u2019s what we\u2019ve been talking about all year long, and we\u2019ve gradually moved our pol icy in the direction of more accommodation.  I think what you see is an economy that has reacted well to that.  So that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re doing it. We never take into account political considerations.  There\u2019s no place in our discuss ions for that.  We also don\u2019t conduct monetary policy in order to prove our independence.  We conduct monetary policy in order to\u2014to  move as close as possible to our statutory goals, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re always going to do.  We\u2019re always going to use our tools that way .  And then, at the end, we\u2019ll \u2014you know, we\u2019ll live with the results. In terms of the balance sheet, that was really just a matter of simplicity and consistency. Really nothing more to it than that. GREG ROBB.  Thank you, Chairman Powell.  G reg Robb from MarketWatch.  I was wondering \u2014we weren\u2019t in the room, but I think it\u2019s a fair assumption to know that the two dissenters probably spoke about financial stability concerns.  So I was wondering if you could talk about what you\u2014what was your res ponse to them when those concerns were raised ?  I\u2019ve\n\nJuly 31, 2019    Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\ncollected a couple of things from the IMF , and the Bank of International Settlements said that it\u2019s just\u2014when you have low rates, you just get more debt in the economy, and that there\u2019s also this feeling  that it makes it harder to raise rates.  So could you talk about that?  Thank you. CHAIR POWELL.  Ye s.  So, first , let me say \u2014I\u2019ll just speak for myself, but I understand those concerns very well.  I do.  I\u2019ve \u2014you know, I\u2019ve studied them, I\u2019ve spoken about them, and I take them very seriously.  But as I look at today\u2019s situation, I don\u2019t see them as a reason not to take this action today.  I just don\u2019t think\u2014that would be my point.  And one of the reasons why I think that is , if you look\u2014if you look\u2014so  we have a financial stability framework now for the first time.  Before the crisis, we didn\u2019t have this, but now we have it, and we publish it.  And we look at , really , four big things so that we know we can\u2014 you know, the public can hold us accountable and compare us meeting to meeting , and\u2014you know, and see whether we got this right , because it\u2019s transparent now. But the four things we look at are valuation pressures .  And we do see notable valuation pressures in some markets but , you know, honestly , not at a highly troubling level.  In terms of household borrowing, household and business borrowing is the second thing .  Households are in a very good shape overall.  I\u2019ll come back to business borrowing.  Leverage in the financial system is low, and funding risk is low.  So, overall, staff\u2019s view has been\u2014 and my view has been \u2014that if you look overall , financial stability vulnerabilities are moderate. The place that gets all the attention right now \u2014a lot of attention \u2014is business borrowing, and we look very car efully at that.  What\u2019s happening with business borrowing is , the loans have moved off the balance sheets of the banks and into market -based vehicles, which tend to be stably funded.  B ut, nonetheless, it\u2019s clear that the highly leveraged business sector c ould act as an amplifier to a downturn.  So we\u2019re watching that very carefully.  But , again, I think if you\n\nJuly 31, 2019    Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nlook overall at the U.S. financial system, what you see is a high level of resilience\u2014much higher than it was before the crisis \u2014and that\u2019s something  to take comfort from.  And I think all of that gives us the ability to use monetary policy for its purposes and rely on supervisory and regulatory tools to \u2014you know, to keep the financial system resilient. GREG ROBB.  So you\u2019re not doing something today f or\u2014to help today, and then it\u2019s going to cause problems down the road?  Y ou\u2019re not worried about that kind of dynamic? CHAIR POWELL.  There are very few things that I don\u2019t worry about at all.  So, of course, of course, we monitor.  We have\u2014every quarter w e have an extensive briefing on financial stability, and we had that yesterday.  So we look at this on an ongoing basis.  We have a great team.  We liaise with central banks around the world.  You know, one of my colleagues is the head of the Financial Stability Board globally, so we\u2019re very, very much monitoring these things all the time.  And we worry about them all the time.  We\u2019re always looking at the \u2014we\u2019re looking for that thing that we may have missed a lot of the time.  But the things we haven\u2019t missed, I think they paint a mixed picture, but not one that should prevent us from taking monetary policy actions that we think are appropriate to support the economy. MARTIN CRUTSINGER.  Marty Crutsinger, AP.  You\u2019ve talked in this press conference about be ing data dependent going forward, and that this is not the start of a series of rate cuts.  But the financial markets seem to think that this is the start of a series of rate cuts, and they\u2019re predicting three, four cuts this year.  Is this your effort to try to damp down that \u2014that thing? CHAIR POWELL.  No .  Let me be clear.  What I said was , it\u2019s not \u2014it\u2019s not the beginning of a long series of rate cuts.  I didn\u2019t \u2014I didn\u2019t  say it \u2019s just one or anything like that. What I said is, when you think about rate -cutting cycles, they go on for a long time, and the\n\nJuly 31, 2019    Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nCommittee is not seeing that\u2014not seeing us in that place.  You would do that if you saw real economic weakness and you thought that the federal funds rate needed to be cut a lot.  That\u2019s not what we\u2019re seeing.  That\u2019s not what we\u2019re seeing. What we\u2019re seeing is that it\u2019s appropriate to \u2014to adjust policy to a somewhat more accommodative stance over time, and that\u2019s how we\u2019re looking  at it.  What I said was , it\u2019s not a long cutting cycle \u2014in other words , referring to what we do when there\u2019s a recession or a very severe downturn.  That\u2019s \u2014that\u2019s  really what I was ruling out.  I think, if you look back at other midcycle adjustments , you\u2019l l see\u2014 you know, I don\u2019t know that they\u2019ll be , in the end, comparable or not, but you\u2019ll see examples of these. DON LEE.  Don Lee with the L.A. Times .  You mentioned the difficulty of assessing trade tensions in  the economic outlook.  Could you say how much of a factor the U.S.\u2013China trade conflict was in the Fed\u2019s decision to cut rates ?  And if the current stalemate and the threat of more tariffs continue , what would that mean for future interest rates and possible cuts? CHAIR POWELL.   So, you know, I wouldn\u2019t bring it down to any one trade thing or any one factor.  I think we look at a broad range of factors , and trade uncertainty \u2014trade policy uncertainty is one of them .  That certainly includes the discussions with China, but I wouldn\u2019t \u2014I wouldn\u2019t be able to tell you how much of it is due to that.  And without knowing \u2014you know, I think we \u2014with trade , we have to react to the developments, and we don\u2019t know what they\u2019ll be , and so it\u2019s hard to exactly say.  Certainly, we\u2019ve seen , though, that when there\u2019s a s harp confrontation between two large economies, you can see effects on business confidence pretty quickly and on financial markets pretty quickly.  We saw that in June .  But then we saw them unwind after that , to some extent.  You\u2019ve seen it returning to \u2014to a much lower temperature, I\n\nJuly 31, 2019    Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nthink.  Again, with\u2014with  trade policy, we\u2019re just going to be watching and trying to assess the implications for the \u2014for the  U.S. outlook. DON LEE.  How much of an effect could the tariffs have? CHAIR POWELL.  You know, the mechanical effects of the tariffs are quite small. They\u2019re not large as it relates to the U.S. economy.  The real question is , what are the effects on the economy through the \u2014through the  confidence channel \u2014business confidence channel ?  And , again, very, v ery hard to tease that out.  I\u2019ve seen some research, which \u2014you know, which says that they are meaningful \u2014meaningful effects on \u2014on output .  That\u2019s  to say , not trivial.  And I think that that sounds right, but it\u2019s quite hard to get \u2014there is no way to get a n accurate measure. You have to look at a range of estimates, and I think businesses will tell you that it\u2019s a factor, particularly businesses that have\u2014manufacturing businesses that have supply chains that cross international borders will all tell you th at it\u2019s been a challenge.  Many of them have made adjustments, and they\u2019ve gotten to a place where it\u2019s okay, but it\u2019s \u2014it\u2019s  been a challenge. PAUL KIERNAN.  Paul Kiernan from Dow Jones News wires.  Thanks for the question, Chairman.  As the press conference \u2014as this press conference has gone under  way, markets have declined .  The Dow is down as much as 400 points.  What I\u2019m hearing is a reluctance to provide more guidance around the future path of rates.  And I\u2019m wondering if that reflects a greater lack of consensus on the Committee .  And, you know, how much consensus do you want to see around these decisions , and how split are people about this? CHAIR POWELL.  You know, you\u2019re right.  T here\u2019s a range of views on the Committee, and\u2014but the C ommittee is unifie d, completely unified on our dedication to making the best policy decisions that we can make .  And that means people have a responsibility to do their best thinking and to present that thinking, and I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\n\nJuly 31, 2019    Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nIn terms of the way for ward, we will be monitoring the factors that I mentioned, and we laid that out in the \u2014you know, in the postmeeting statement, and that\u2019s the roadmap we\u2019re going to be following going forward.  We\u2019re going to be data dependent.  We\u2019re going to be, as we always are, doing what we need to do\u2014what we believe we need to do to support the economic expansion. JOHN HELTMAN.  Hi, John Heltman with American Banker .  So it\u2019s been about 18 months since the Fed issued its enforcement  action  against Wells Fargo.  And I w as wondering if you could characterize the progress that the bank has made towards the shortcomings that it had in its risk -management processes .  And I\u2019m also curious whether their lack of a permanent CEO has hampered progress , in your eyes . CHAIR POWELL.   So the problems at  Wells Fargo \u2014that arose at Wells Fargo around risk management and consumer \u2014the way they dealt with the consumer were actually pretty deep, and I think the company realizes that .  And they\u2019re not going to be fixed\u2014they haven\u2019t been fixed  quickly , and, frankly, we didn\u2019t expect them to be fixed quickly.  So they\u2019re \u2014you know, they \u2014they will be under the growth cap, our enforcement action, until the Board votes to lift it, and that\u2019s not something we\u2019re considering doing right now.  And the Committee \u2014I mean, the company is working away to address these issues, but , as I said, they\u2019re deep -seated issues, and it just takes time to address them. I wouldn\u2019t comment on the CEO question.  I don\u2019t really have anything for you on that. JOHN HELTMAN.   I mean , I just \u2014I\u2019d like to  clarify , like , are you pleased with the responsiveness you\u2019re getting from them?  Do you feel like this is going the way that you kind of wanted it to go?\n\nJuly 31, 2019    Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nCHAIR POWELL.  I\u2019m not going to characterize  it.  You know \u2014I mean , I have characterized it.  We have\u2014we have an enforcement action in place.  The company is working away at addressing it.  They take it seriously.  I think they do see it as we do, as something that has to go deep .  And, you know, we\u2019ll lift the growth cap when w e\u2019re satisfied. NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.   Nancy Marshall -Genzer with Marketplace.  So when we have our next recession, the Fed will have less room \u2014it will happen \u2014the Fed will have less room to maneuver cutting interest rates since you\u2019re cutting now.  How bi g of a problem will that be? CHAIR POWELL.  You know, the premise is not \u2014I will question your premise for a second.  If you remember  whether \u2014again, one of the purposes of our \u2014of our  cut today is to support the expansion.  A nd we don\u2019t know when\u2014and if it r eally works \u2014if that works very well and the economy gets going again, you know, you don\u2019t know where the \u2014where the funds, in other cycles \u2014and I don\u2019t know whether this will happen or not , but in other cycles , the Fed wound up raising rates again after a mi dcycle adjustment.  Again, I\u2019m not predicting that, but I don\u2019t think that we know that we won\u2019t have \u2014that we\u2019ll have less ammo because of these things.  That\u2019s one thing.  So \u2014 NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.   But you won\u2019t be able to cut as much if \u2014if rates are low.  I mean,  you will have \u2014have  less ammo , in that sense. CHAIR POWELL.  Well, but you\u2019re assuming that we would never raise rates again, that once we\u2019ve cut these rates that they can never go back up again.  Just as a matter of principle, I don\u2019t think tha t\u2019s right.  In other \u2014in other  long, long cycles, long U.S. business cycles have sometimes involved this kind of event where the Fed will stop hiking \u2014in fact , will cut\u2014and then will go back to hiking.  Again, I don\u2019t know whether that\u2019ll happen right here.  It doesn\u2019t\n\nJuly 31, 2019    Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nseem \u2014it doesn\u2019t seem like something that\u2019s  in\u2014you know, particularly likely, frankly, but we don\u2019t know that. And the other thing is, I think by extending the cycle , you\u2014you do have a lot of benefits from that .  And I think, you know, we will use the tools that we have .  A couple of rate hikes one way or the other isn\u2019t going to matter so much if there is a downturn.  And you\u2019re right, there will eventually be one.  We\u2019ll use all of our tools aggressively, as we need to, when that time comes. JEAN YUNG.  Hi, Jean Yung with MNI.  Can you give us an update on the ongoing reassessment of the inflation framework?  And have the discussions so far this year had any bearing on today\u2019s decision? CHAIR POWELL.  So the monetary policy review is really for \u2014it\u2019s really there to look at the way we make policy in the longer run.  It\u2019s not something that enters directly into our discussions today.  We\u2019ve had\u2014so far we\u2019ve had a series of meetings , called Fed Listens , at almost all the R eserve Banks.  Soon it will  be all the R eserve Banks.  And we meet there with the constituencies that we serve, and they\u2019ve been very, very successful, hearing from people \u2014not just\u2014not just  economists, but people who are not economists , how \u2014how  their lives interact with the Fed\u2019s wo rk.  It\u2019s been \u2014it\u2019s been great.  I \u2019ve got to say, it\u2019s been even better than I hoped it would be. We\u2019re just now beginning the process of incorporating all of that feedback, and we\u2019re going to be having a series of meetings, beginning today and yesterday, as we evaluate, you know, the questions that we\u2019re asking about our framework.  So it\u2019s very early to say where that\u2019s going, but, you know, we\u2019re setting the table now and looking at what our framework is\n\nJuly 31, 2019    Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nand looking at how it\u2019s performed, looking at how all frameworks performed around the world during the  Global F inancial C risis.  I expect we\u2019ll be at this a while. I\u2019m very excited about it.  I think it\u2019s been a good exercise.  I think it\u2019s opened us up to sunlight and perspectives that we might not have gotten otherwise.  And I think it\u2019s a good time. You know, you have \u201410  years after the crisis, you\u2019re really living in a new normal for the economy and monetary policy, and it\u2019s a really good time to step back and ask whether there are some things that we  can do to improve our framework. COURTENAY BROWN.   Hi, Mr. Chairman.  Courtenay Brown from Axios.  Can you give us a sense of whether the C ommittee feels constrained at all by the market\u2019s expectations for more cuts or other developments in financial markets? CHAIR POWELL.   So I think this was \u2014this was  well telegraphed.  What we did today was\u2014was  very consistent with what we had said we were going to do.  I had mentioned the reasons for it.  They\u2019ve been well telegraphed, and I think\u2014 you know, I think they  will\u2014they will achieve their goals. We do know that monetary policy works through communications and then actions that are consistent with those communications, and we think that the changes that we\u2019ve made this year have really worked.  Of course, we alw ays retain the flexibility to adjust our communications and our actions to \u2014in light of incoming data and the evolving risk picture , but\u2014I\u2019ll leave it there . BRIAN CHEUNG.  Hi, Brian Che ung with Yahoo Finance.  Just to expand on that point about communication , I mean , we saw that markets have been particularly sensitive with  regards to New York Fed P resident John Williams\u2019s remarks before the blackout period.  So the Fed added language in the statement that says that the Committee is contemplating  the future path of\n\nJuly 31, 2019    Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nthe target range for the federal funds rate as it monitors implications .  I\u2019m wondering\u2014now there\u2019s kind of this inflection point about whether or not the downside risk, because you\u2019ve had to cut rates , outweighs the fact that you still see a positive outlook of the U.S. economy at a baseline.  So, just wondering if you can kind of clarify all those things within the context of the challenges of communicating it. CHAIR POWELL.  Ye ah, so again, I see the U.S. outlook as being a positive one.  And we do \u2014we have had these global , really, risks to the outlook.  There really \u2014there really  is nothing in the U.S. economy that presents a \u2014you know, a prominent near -term threat to the U.S. economy.  As I mentioned, there\u2019s no\u2014there\u2019s no segment that \u2019s really \u2014or sector that\u2019s really boiling over and overheating.  Nothing like that.  It\u2019s \u2014it\u2019s  within \u2014within the economy.  It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s healthy , so I would say that.  Downside risks are really coming from abroad.  A nd, of course , we are concerned about \u2014about  low inflation.  But \u2014and , by the way, those risks from abroad are affecting the manufacturing sector here and business investment \u2014fixed investment.  S o\u2014 thank you."

Good afternoon , everyone, and welcome.   My colleagues at the Federal Reserve and I are dedicated to serving the American people.  We do this by steadfastly pursuing the goals Congress has given us :  maximum employment and stable prices.  We are committed to making the best decisions we can based on facts and objective analysis.  To day we decided to lower interest rates.  As I will explain shortly, we took this step to help keep the U.S. economy strong in the face of some notable developments and to provide insurance against ongoing risks. The U.S. economy has continued to perform we ll.  We are into the 11th year of this economic expansion, and the baseline outlook remains favorable.  The eco nomy grew at a 2\u00bd percent pace in the first half of the year.  H ousehold spending\u2014support ed by a strong job market, rising incomes, and solid con sumer confidence \u2014has been the key driver of growth.  In contrast, business investment and exports have weakened amid falling manufacturing output . The main reasons appear to be slower growth abroad and trade policy developments \u2014two sources of uncertainty that we \u2019ve been monitoring all year. Since the middle of last year, the global growth outlook has weakened , notably in Europe and China.  Additionally, a number of geopolitical risks, including Brexit, remain unresolved. Trade policy tensions have waxed a nd waned, and elevated uncertainty is weighing on U.S. investment and exports.  Our business contacts around the country have been telling us that uncertainty about trade policy has discouraged them from  investing in  their businesses.  B usiness fixed inves tment posted a modest decline in the second quarter , and recent indicators point to continued softness.  Even so, with household spending remaining on a solid footing and with supportive financial conditions, we expect the economy to continue to expand at a moderate rate.\n\nSeptember 18, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nAs seen from FOMC participants \u2019 most recent projections , the median expectation for real GDP growth remains near 2 percent this year and next before edging down toward its estimated longer -run value. The job market remains strong .  The unemployment rate has been near half -century lows for a year and a half, and  job gains have remain ed solid in recent months.  The pace of job gains has eased this year, but we had expected some slowing after last year\u2019s strong pace. Participation in the labor force  by people in their prime working years has been increasing.  And wages have been rising, particularly for lower -paying jobs.  People who live and work in low - and middle -income communities tell us that many who have struggled to find work are now getting opportunities to add new and better chapters to their lives.  This underscores , for us , the importance of sustaining the expansion so that the strong job market reaches more of those left behind.  We expect the job market to remain strong .  The m edian of participants\u2019 projections for the unemployment rate remains below 4 percent over the next several years. Inflation continues to run below our symmetric 2 percent objective.  Over the 12 months through July, t otal PCE inflation was 1.4 percent and core inflation , which excludes volatile food and energy prices, w as 1.6 percent.  We still expect inflation to rise to 2 percent; the median projection is 1.9 percent this year and 2 percent in 2021.1  However, inflation pressures clearly remain muted, and indicators of longer -term inflation expectations are at the lower end of their historical ranges.  We are mindful that continued below -target inflation could lead to an unwelcome downward slide in longer -term inflation expectations. Overall, as we say in our postmeeting statement, we continue to see sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent\n\n1 Chair Powell intended to say that the median projection is 1.9 percent next year.\n\nSeptember 18, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nobjective as most likely.  While this has been our outlook for quite some time , our views about the path of interest rates that will best achieve these outcomes have changed significantly over the past year.  As I mentioned, weakness in global growth and trade policy uncertainty have weighed on the economy and pose ongoing risks .  These factors, i n conjunction with muted inflation pressures , have led us to shift our views about appropriate monetary policy over time toward a lower path for the federal funds rate , and this shift has supported the outlook.  Of course, this is the role of monetary poli cy\u2014to adjust interest rates to maintain a strong labor market and keep inflation near our 2 percent objective. Today\u2019s decision to lower the federal funds rate target by \u00bc percent , to 1.75  percent to 2 percent , is appropriate in light of the global developments I mentioned as well as muted inflation pressures.  Since our last meeting, we have seen additional signs of weakness abroad and a resurgence of trade policy tensions, including the imposition of additional tariffs.  The Fed has no role in the for mulation of trade policy, but we do take  into account anything that could materially affect the economy relative to our employment and inflation goals. The future course of monetary policy will depend on how the economy evolves and what developments imply for the economic outlook and risks to the outlook.  We have often said that policy is not on a preset course, and that is certainly the case today.  As I have noted, the  baseline economic outlook remains positive.  The projections of appropriate policy  show that participants generally anticipate only modest changes in the federal funds rate  over the next couple of years . Of course, those views are merely forecasts and , as always,  will evolve with the arrival of new information. Let me say a few words about  our monetary policy operations.  Funding pressures in money markets were elevated this week, and the effective federal funds rate rose above the top\n\nSeptember 18, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nof its target range yesterday.  While these issues are important for market functioning and market partici pants, they  have no implications for the economy or the stance of monetary policy.  This upward pressure emerged as funds flowed from the private sector to the Treasury to meet corporate tax payments and settle purchases of Treasury securities.  To counter  these pressures, we conducted overnight repurchase operations yesterday and again today.  These temporary operations were effective in relieving funding pressures, and we expect the federal funds rate to move back into the target range.  In addition, as w e have done in the past, we made a technical adjustment to the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances, setting it 20 basis points below the top of the target range for the federal funds rate.  In a related action, we also adjusted the r ate on the overnight repurchase facility to 5 basis points below the bottom of the target range.  We will continue to monitor market developments and will conduct operations as necessary to foster trading in the federal funds market at rates within the target range.  Consistent with our decision earlier this year to continue to implement monetary policy in an ample -reserves regime, we will, over time, provide a sufficient supply of reserves so that frequent operations are not required. To summarize, we are fully committed to pursuing our goals of maximum employment and stable prices.  As the Committee contemplates the future path of the target range for the federal funds rate, it will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the econ omic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near its symmetric 2  percent objective. Thanks .  I\u2019ll be happy to take your questions.\n\nSeptember 18, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nMARTIN CRUTSINGER.  Marty Crutsinger with the Associated Pres s.  Mr. Chairman, when you cut rates in July, you characterized it as  a \u201cmidcycle adjustment .\u201d  Is that still your view of what \u2019s happening? CHAIR POWELL .  So, as you can see from our policy statement and from the SEP, we see a favorable economic outlook, with continued moderate growth, a strong labor market, and inflation near our 2 percent objective .  And , by the way, that view is consistent with those of many other forecasters.  As you can see, FOMC participants generally think that these positive economic outcomes will be achieved with modest adjustments to the federal funds rate .  At the last press conference, I pointed to two episodes in , I guess , 1995 and 1998 as examples of such an approach, which was successful in both of those instances .  As our statement also highlights , though, there are risks to this positive outlook due particularly to weak global growth and trade developments .  And if the economy does turn down, then a more extensive sequence of rate cuts could be appropriate .  We don\u2019 t see that \u2014it\u2019s not what we expect \u2014but we would certainly follow that path if it became appropriate .  In other words, as we say in our statement, we will continue to monitor these developments closely, and we will act as appropriate to help ensure that the ex pansion remains on track. RICHARD MILLER.  [ Inaudible remark ]  I\u2019m  sorry .  Rich Miller with Bloomberg . Taking the statement, your opening remarks, and the SEP,  I \u2019m just wondering what kind of message we should take from this.  Do you still \u2014does the FOMC \u2014is it safe to say the  FOMC still has an easing bias or not? CHAIR POWELL .  So the idea of having a bias is something that was a longtime practice, and we don \u2019t actually have that practice anymore, so I can \u2019t really adopt it right here . But, nonetheless, I \u2019ll respond to your question.  So we did\u2014we made one decision today, and\n\nSeptember 18, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nthat decision was to lower the federal funds rate by \u00bc percentage point .  We believe that action is appropriate to promote our objectives, of course .  We\u2019re going to be highly data dependent, as always.  Our decisions are going to depend on the implications of incoming information for the outlook, and I would also say, as we often do, that we \u2019re not on a preset course.  So that \u2019s how we\u2019re going to look at it .  We\u2019re going to be care fully looking at economic data .  Sometimes the path ahead is clear and sometimes less so .  So we \u2019re going to be looking carefully, meeting by meeting , at the full range of information, and we \u2019re going to assess the appropriate stance of policy as we go.  A nd, as I said, we will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion. RICHARD MILLER.  If I could just follow up, you\u2019 ve also said that the favorable outlook is predicated on financial conditions, and the financial conditions are in tur n predicated on an outlook for F ed policy\u2014 in this case, further cuts .  Wouldn\u2019 t that suggest that you should be inclined to\u2014if you want those financial conditions and that favorable outlook to come about, you should be inclined to cut? CHAIR POWELL .  Well, what we do going f orward is very much going to depend, Rich, on the flow of data and information.  We\u2019ve seen \u2014you know, if you look at the things we \u2019re monitoring, particularly global growth and trade development s, global growth has continued to weaken .  I think it \u2019s weaken ed since our last meeting .  Trade developments have been up and down and then up, I guess \u2014or back up, perhaps \u2014over the course of this intermeeting  period .  In any case, they \u2019ve been quite volatile .  So we do see those risks as actually more heightened now . We\u2019re going to be watching that carefully.  We \u2019re also going to be watching the U.S . data quite carefully, and we \u2019ll have to make an assessment as we go. NICK TIMIRAOS .  Thank you, Mr . Chairman .  Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.  I know you\u2019 re trying to speak for the C ommittee when you do these press conferences,\n\nSeptember 18, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nbut the C ommittee is clearly divided right now, at least about the outlook and the appropriate policy path.  Some people think you need to wait and see the labor market and the consumer crack or weaken further before acting more aggressively, and some people think that by the time that happens, you\u2019 ll need to do even more aggressive action to arrest a downturn.  Where do you stand on this? CHAIR POWELL .  Well, let me just say, on the general point of diverse perspectives, you\u2019re right .  Sometimes the \u2014and there have been many of those times in my now almost eight years at the Fed, many times when the direction i s relatively clear and it \u2019s relatively  easy to reach unanimity.  This is a time  of difficult judgments and, as you can see, disparate perspectives.  And I really do think that \u2019s nothing but healthy, and so I see a benefit in having those diverse perspectives , really .  So your question, though, is? NICK TIMIRAOS .  This is to your own view , because the data is, to some extent , lagged, especially when you have these risks on the horizon, and the markets obviously think that these risks could materialize more than what you and your colleagues are projecting in the dot plot today.  So, I w onder, where are your own views about the tension between risk management, which implies some degree of data independence, and this idea of being data dependent ? CHAIR POWELL .  Yes.  S o I\u2019ll try to get at that this way .  I think that the idea that if you s ee trouble approaching on the horizon, you steer away from it if you can\u2014I think that \u2019s a good idea in principle , and I think history teaches us that it \u2019s better to be proactive in adjusting policy if you can. I think applying that principle in a particula r situation is where the challenge comes.  So I told you where  the C ommittee \u2014the bulk of the Committee is going , meeting by meeting, and I think the main takeaway is that this is a C ommittee that has shifted its policy stance repeatedly,\n\nSeptember 18, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nconsistently , through the course of the year to support economic activity as it has  felt that it \u2019s appropriate .  At the beginning of the year we were looking at further rate increases, then we were patient, and then we cut once, then we cut again.  And I think you\u2019 ve seen u s being willing to move based on data, based on the evolving risk picture , and I have no reason to think that will change .  I think \u2014but it will continue to be data dependent, and depend\u2014data  includes the evolving risk picture .  That \u2019s where I am, and that \u2019s where I think the bulk of the C ommittee is. STEVE LIESMAN .  Mr . Chairman, I wonder if  you\u2019 re\u2014oh, sorry.  Steve Liesman, CNBC.  I \u2019ve only done this a dozen \u2014a lot of times .  I wonder if you\u2019 re concerned about how the Federal Reserve operated through the re cent liquidity crunch in markets .  We talked to many traders who said the tax date payment was known well in advance .  There were several reports of people pointing to September as a potential crunch time .  You closed Monday at the top end of the fed funds  rate.  Tuesday came along, and ther e wasn \u2019t an operation until nine  o\u2019clock  and no announcement until \u2014of a second operation until four o\u2019clock in the afternoon.  Was the F ed listening to markets well ahead of time, going back a year when there were blowouts in the overnight rate at year -end and the turn of the year?  Are you concerned about how, for example, the New York F ed operated through this? CHAIR POWELL .  You know, so I would say I doubt that anyone is closer to and has more invested in carefully following the \u2014you know, the behavior of these markets .  So, of course, we were well aware of the \u2014you know, the tax payments and also of the settlement of the large bond purchases .  And, you know, we were very much waiting for that .  But we didn\u2019 t expect \u2014the response to that was stronger than we expected .  And, by the way, our sense is that it surprised market participants a lot , too.  You know , people were writing about this and publishing stories about it weeks ago .  It wasn \u2019t a surprise, but it was \u2014it was  a stronger response\n\nSeptember 18, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nthan\u2014certainly than we expected .  So, no, I \u2019m not concerned about that , to answer your question.  I can go on a little bit about how we \u2019re looking at that .  Why don\u2019 t I do that? So, as I mentioned, it doesn\u2019 t\u2014we don \u2019t see this as havin g any implications for the broader economy or for the economic outlook, n or for our ability to control rates .  The strains in the money markets reflect forces that we saw coming, and they just had a bigger effect than I think most folks anticipated \u2014strong demand for cash to purchase T reasuries and pay corporate taxes.  We took appropriate actions to address those pressures, to keep the fed funds rate within the target range, and those measures were successful .  If we experience another episode of pressures in money markets, we have the tools to address those pressures.  We will not hesitate to use them . And since we \u2019re talking about this, let me take a step back and say this.  Earlier in the year, as you will all recall, after careful study over a period of years, actually, the C ommittee announced the decision to implement monetary policy in an ample -reserves regime.  And we \u2019ve been operating in that regime for a full decade .  We think it works well to implement our rate decisions .  The main hallmark of that regime is that we use adjustments in our administered rates\u2014 the IOER and RRP rates\u2014to keep the fed fund rates in the target range.  It \u2019s designed specifically so that we do not expect to be conducting frequent open market operations for that purpose .  So, going forward, we \u2019re going to be very closely monitoring market developments and assessing their implications for the appropriate level of reserves, and we\u2019 re going to be assessing, you know, the question of when it will be appropriate to resume the organi c growth of our balance sheet .  And I \u2019m sure we\u2019 ll be revisiting that question during this intermeeting  period and certainly at our next meeting.\n\nSeptember 18, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nSTEVE LIESMAN .  Could  I just follow up here quickly?  D o you think you\u2019 ve underestimated the amount of reserves necessary for the banking system? CHAIR POWELL .  So we \u2019ve always said that it \u2019s\u2014that the level is uncertain, right ? And that \u2019s something we \u2019ve tried to be very clear about .  And as you know, we \u2019ve invested lots of time talking to many of the large holde rs of reserves to assess their \u2014what they say is their demand for reserves.  We try to assess what that is.  We \u2019ve tried to combine all of that together . We put it out so the public can react to it.  But , yes, there \u2019s real uncertainty, and it is certainly possible that we will need to resume the organic growth of the balance sheet earlier than we thought .  That \u2019s always been a possibility, and it certainly is now .  Again, we \u2019ll be looking at this carefully in coming days and taking it up at the next meeting. BRENDAN GREELEY.  Brendan Greeley with the Financial Times .  Earlier this year \u2014 or, actually , in September, the G overnors \u2019 Board put out a research paper looking\u2014trying to quantify trade uncertainty.  A nd it suggested that it could drag through the busine ss investment channel on growth as much as a percentage point over the course of the next year .  How much confidence do you have in the F ed\u2019s ability to estimate the real effects of trade uncertainty ?  And if you have confidence in that paper, it would see m to suggest a \u2014sort of a more aggressively dovish path than the one that you \u2019ve chosen. CHAIR POWELL .  Yes.  So I thin k to provide a little context, F ed economists do research all the time .  It\u2019s generally of  very high quality.  It \u2019s their research .  It\u2019s not an official finding of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Reserve System .  It\u2019s just \u2014and, by the way, they put it out for public review so that you can see their econometrics, so you can see all of it \u2014 their whole work is exposed to critique by the whole profession.  So it \u2019s a great tradition that we have .  And, you know, what this particular piece of work did is , it went after measuring trade\n\nSeptember 18, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\npolicy uncertainty through a couple of channels , including concerning tariffs, also concerning the threat of more tariffs, and it looked deeply at the data to try to assess the effects on output .  And while I would say, directly answering your question, there \u2019s real uncertainty around these \u2014 around these effects.  It\u2019 s a $22 trillion  economy.  T o try to isolate  the effects of certain things is very challenging, but we do the best we can.  So \u2014and this piece of research found significant effects, and that \u2019s frankly consistent with a number of other research projects that economists have undertaken.  It \u2019s also cons istent with what we \u2019ve been hearing in the Beige B ook.  So, I mean , I think if you take a step back from that, we do feel that trade uncertainty is having an effect .  You see it in weak business investment, weak exports \u2014hard to quantify it precisely , though. HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Hi, Howard Schneider with Reuters.  I was struck by the sort of anchored median federal funds rate here through 2020, and that in comparison to the fact that you now have sort of three very discrete groups of opinions around where the  fed funds rate is heading.  A nd I wondered, is it fair to say that the \u2014those opinions have become sort of firmer in their conviction, and that it \u2019s going to take some sort of real material change in the outlook now for that to move in either direction ? CHAIR POWELL .  And you\u2019 re asking specifically about 2020? HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Well, the fact that this \u2014the fed funds rate is now seen as not moving through 2020 suggests to me that these opinions are pretty\u2014pretty  well anchored right now in those groups. CHAI R POWELL.  You know, honestly, I think it \u2019s hard to have hardened expectations about where rate policy is going to be a year from now .  I think the closer you get to the c urrent day, the more confidence  you can have .  But even then, knowing where the\u2014knowi ng what the\n\nSeptember 18, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\ndata will say and the way geopolitical events and other events are going to evolve in the next 90 days and the implications of that for the economy, I would say there \u2019s a lot of uncertainty around that . HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Fair enough, but if \u2014 CHAIR POWELL .  Particularly, if you look at 2020, I think the use of this is , individual participants write down their forecast s.  It should give you a sense of how people are thinking about the likely path of the economy and the appropriate path for mone tary policy in that individual person\u2019 s thinking, and I think that \u2019s a good thing to know .  I think I \u2019d be very reluctant to look at it as hardened views or a prediction , really. HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  But just to follow  up, if I could.  T here were a number of arguments in July around the reason for cutting rates .  Have any of those gotten substantially weaker or changed around the table? CHAIR POWELL .  You know, well , I think , if you look at the U.S.\u2014look at the U.S . economy, the U.S . economy has generally per formed roughly as expected \u2014roughly:   The consumer is spending at a healthy clip,  I \u2019d say business fixed investment and exports have weakened further, and I \u2019d say the manufacturing PMI suggests more weakness ahead .  The labor market is still strong , though, s o generally that is the same .  I think if you look at \u2014the global economy, I think , has weakened further in the EU and China, and I think, you know, trade policy developments have been a big mover of markets and of sentiment during that inter meeting period.  So that \u2019s why I think what \u2019s\u2014that \u2019s what \u2019s happened over the inter meeting  period, and, you know, different people around the table have different perspectives as you obviously know. JEANNA SMIALEK.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Jeanna Smialek with the New York Times .  I\u2019m just curious on your balance sheet point .  You talked about the C ommittee thinking about\n\nSeptember 18, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nresuming organic growth, you know, over time .  I guess the question is, if you have shrunk your balance sheet maybe just a little bit too small to the point that reserves are too scarce to get through sort of these unusual periods, is organic growth in the balance sheet enough to get back to a point of ample reserves that can get us through those tough times , or would you need to see something a little b it above that ?  And is that a possibility the Committee would consider? CHAIR POWELL .  You know, I think it \u2019s hard to deal with every hypothetical possibility.  I think , for the foreseeable future, we \u2019re going to be looking at, if needed, doing the sorts o f things that we did the last two days \u2014these temporary open market operations .  That will be the tool that we use .  And the question will be , then\u2014as we go through quarter -end, as we learn more, you know, what really \u2014how much of this really has to do with the level of reserves? And I think we \u2019ll learn quite a lot in the next six weeks. VICTORIA GUIDA.  Victoria Guida  with Politico .  Another money market question. You know, banks have been pointing to liquidity rules as having contributed to some of the volatility we \u2019ve seen in repo markets and, you know, potentially some capital rules as well .  Are you all looking at whether, you know, some tweaks to the liquidity coverage ratio might help ? And, also , what is the status of the net  stable funding ratio rul e?  Are you all still planning on putting that out soon? CHAIR POWELL .  You know, so I think if we concluded that we needed to raise the level of required reserves for banks to meet the LCR, we\u2019 d probably raise the level of reserves rather than lower the LCR.  I mean , it\u2019s not impossible that we would come to a view that the LCR is calibrated too high, but that \u2019s not something that we think right now .  On the other hand, it might be that more reserves are needed, in which case we are in a position to suppl y them .  In\n\nSeptember 18, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nterms of the net stable funding ratio, it \u2019s\u2014I believe we  put it out for comment and got comments, and I believe we \u2019re looking at \u2014at finalizing that in the relatively near future. VICTORIA GUIDA.  Just \u2014just  to follow up, I mean, in terms of twea ks to the LCR, I mean , there \u2019s also been some talk about potentially giving banks some room in times of stress to maybe dip into their liquidity buffers. CHAIR POWELL .  I think we want banks to, you know \u2014to use their liquidity buffers in times of stress rather than pull back from the markets and pull back from serving their clients as a general rule. EDWARD LAWRENCE .  So, about a month ago\u2014Edward Lawrence from Fox Business Network .  Thank you, Mr . Chairman .  About a month ago or so you said that there \u2019s no precedent to integrate trade uncertainty in to monetary policy.  In the last few weeks, have you figured out how to incorporate trade uncertainty \u2014and this level of trade uncertainty \u2014into monetary policy going forward ?  You\u2019ve  talked about uncertainty many times today. CHAIR POWELL .  So my point , really , was that \u2014to start , that trade pol icy is not the business of the F ed, it \u2019s the business of Congress and the A dministration .  But \u2014so why are we talking about it?  We \u2019re talking about it because anything tha t affects the achievement of our goals can , in principle , be something that monetary policy should take into consideration.  And our discussions and the research we have suggests that trade policy is something that \u2019s weighing on the outlook.  So I pointed out in recent remarks that the thing we can \u2019t address, really , is what businesses would like, which is a settled roadmap for international trade .  We can \u2019t do that .  We don\u2019t have that tool .  But we do have a very powerful tool which can counteract weakness , to some extent , by supporting demand through sound monetary policy.  A nd we think our policy tools support economic activity through fairly well -understood channels :  by reducing interest\n\nSeptember 18, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nburden and encouraging consumer purchase of durables , of homes , and other interest- sensitive items ; by creating broadly more accommodative financial conditions, which support spending and also investment by businesses ; and also by boosting household and business confidence .  So, you know, I don\u2019 t want to be heard to say that our tools don \u2019t have an effect .  They do.  B ut I was making the point that there is a piece of this that we really can \u2019t address. EDWARD LAWRENCE .  So have you figured out how to navigatge it? CHAIR POWELL .  Well, I think, yeah.  I mean , it\u2019s a challe nge.  There \u2019s no simple bottom -line answer where I can say, yes, I \u2019ve got it for you here .  But what it amounts to is this : What you see is probably the kind of volatility that \u2019s typical of an important , complex, ongoing negotiation.  And I think what we need to do is to try to look through the volatility and react to the underlying forces, the underlying things that are happening that are relevant to our mandate . We don\u2019 t\u2014we have nothing to do with setting trade policy or negotiating trade agreements . We\u2019re supposed to be reacting on behalf of the American economy to support maximum employment and stable prices.  So we need to look through what \u2019s a pretty volatile situation .  So that means not overreacting quickly.  It means not underreacting, too.  So t hat\u2019s really what we\u2019re trying to do.  And, you know, I would say, the outlook is positive in the face of these crosswinds we\u2019 ve felt .  And so, to some extent , I do believe that our shifting to a more accommodative stance over the course of the year has been one of the reasons why the outlook has remained favorable. MICHAEL MCKEE .  Fed funds \u2014Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television .  Fed funds futures t rading since the statement was released shows that investors still think that another rate cut is coming this year .  On their behalf, let me ask, what is going to guide Fed policy to either pull them towards where the dot plot suggests no more moves this year or\n\nSeptember 18, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nkeep them in place ?  Are you reacting to data now?  Are you reacting to your gut feeling about what trade tweets might mean?  Should they just watch for Jay Powell speeches to decide what \u2019s going to ha ppen going forward?  What \u2019s the F ed\u2019s reaction f unction now? CHAIR POWELL .  Right .  So what we are looking for through all of the data, all the events that are going on around the world, we \u2019ll be looking at, you know, the evolving geopolitical events , we\u2019ll be looking at global growth, w e\u2019ll be looking at trade policy uncertainty.  Most importantly, we \u2019ll be looking at the performance of the U.S . economy.  We\u2019ll be looking for things that are affecting the outlook for the U.S . economy, particularly the outlook as it relates to maximum employment and stab le prices.  So all of those things in principle can affect the achievement of our goals .  It\u2019s an unusual situation , because, you know, the U.S . economy itself \u2014the largest part of it, the consumer part of it \u2014is in strong shape .  The manufacturing part, les s so.  But , overall, you see an economy that \u2014I think , generally , forecasts show  growth similar to our own, forecasts coming in about 2 percent, which is a good, solid year.  So the difference here is, we have significant , really , risks to that outlook from not just the geopolitical events , but also from slowing global growth and tra de policy uncertainty.  So we \u2019ll be looking at all of that and also financial market conditions and how they are affecting the outlook.  I can \u2019t\u2014it\u2019s a challenging time, I admit it, but we really have to be open to all those things .  We \u2019re not on a preset course .  We\u2019re going to be making decisions meeting by meeting as we see this, and , you know, we \u2019ll try to be as transparent as we can as we go. DONNA BORAK.  Donna Borak.  Hi, Chairman Powell.  Donna Borak with CNN.  With the rate cut today and potentially another modest adjustment coming down the road, do  you worry about lessening the F ed\u2019s firepo wer should there be a recession?  A nd is there any\n\nSeptember 18, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nscenario in which you would envision rates drifting lower into negative territory?  A nd are there any other tools that you could use before having to go there?  Thanks. CHAIR POWELL.  You know, in terms of firepower, I think the general principle, as I mentione d earlier, is , it can be a mistake to try to hold onto your firepower until a downturn gains momentum, and then\u2014so there \u2019s a fair amount of research that would show that that \u2019s the case.  Now, I think that principle need s to be applied carefully to the situation at hand.  Wha t we believe we\u2019 re facing here\u2014what we th ink we \u2019re facing here is a situation which can be addressed and should be addressed with moderate adjustments to the federal funds rate.  As I mentioned, we are  watching carefully to see whether that is the case.  If , in fact , the economy weakens more, then we \u2019re prepared to be aggressive, and we \u2019ll do so if it turns out to be appropriate. You mentioned negative interest rates.  So negative interest rates is some thing that we looked at during the financial crisis and chose not to do.  We chose to \u2014after we got to the effective lower bound, we chose to do a lot of aggressive forward guidance and also large -scale asset purchases, and those were the two unconventional  monetary policy tools that we used extensively.  We feel that they worked fairly well.  We did not use negative rates .  And I think if we were to find ourselves at some future date again at the effective lower bound\u2014again, not something we are expecting\u2014 then I think we would look at using large -scale asset purchases and forward guidance.  I do not think we \u2019d be looking at using negative rates.  I just don\u2019 t think those will be at the top of our list. By the way, we are in the middle of a monetary policy re view where we \u2019re looking through all of these questions about the longer -run framework \u2014the strategy , tools , and communications \u2014and we expect that to be completed sometime around the middle of next year.\n\nSeptember 18, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nDON LEE.  Don Lee  with the L.A. Times .  How much \u2014can you talk about the mechanism in which the two rate cuts will affect the real economy ?  And how much \u2014to what extent  will it offset the negative effects of the trade uncertainty and tensions? CHAIR POWELL.  So, in terms of how our rate cuts will affect the real economy, first, we th ink monetary policy works with, as Friedman said , long and variable lags.  So I think the real effects will be felt over time.  But, you know, we think that l ower interest rates will reduce interest burden for borrowers , so that interest -sensitive things like housing and durable goods and other things like that \u2014cars \u2014it supports purchases of those.  Just, again, broadly, more accommodative financial conditions \u2014higher asset prices.  T hat\u2019s\u2014the models and the data show that that\u2019s another powerful channel. I also think there \u2019s a confidence channel.  You see \u2014you see household and business confidence turn up when financial conditions become more accommodative.  So I think, through all of those channels , monetary policy works.  It isn \u2019t, you know, precisely the right tool for every single possible negative thing that can happen to the economy, but , nonetheless, it broadly works, and, you know, we \u2019re going to use the tool  we have.  And if it comes to it, we \u2019ll use all of our tools .  So that \u2019s how we think it works and how we think it \u2019s working. DON LEE.  And how much will it offset the trade  impact, do you think ? CHAIR POWELL.  It \u2019s very hard to say.  It\u2019s \u2014you know, it\u2019 s tough to say.  We \u2019ll\u2014 we\u2019ll us e our tools to offset negative \u2014that\u2019s really the job of monetary policy, is, to the extent it can, to offset, you know, things that drive us away from maximum employment and stable prices. NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  I \u2019m Nancy Marshall -Genzer with Marketplace.  Chair Powell, are you worried that the low interest rates are adding to , or could create a bubble of ,\n\nSeptember 18, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nconsumer and corporate debt that could make it more difficult for , especially , consumers to recover from the next recession or survive the next recession? CHAIR POWELL .  You know, so, if you look at \u2014if you actually look at households, households are in very strong shape.  They\u2019 re less levered.  They \u2019ve got less debt.  They\u2019 ve got more income relative to their interest requirements.  And they \u2019re in very good shape \u2014much better shape than they were in before the financial crisis.  So the household sector as a sort of aggregate matter is in very good shape.  That doesn\u2019 t mean that every single person in the household sector is in good shape, but , overall , it\u2019s really not a concern. The business sector is something that, you know, we \u2019ve talked about a lot and studied a lot, and the situation there is that the level of debt relative to GDP in the business sector is at a high level.  However, so is the size of the business sector.  So, actually, the business sector itself is not materially higher leverage d tha n it was.  Nonetheless, there are a lot of highly levered companies, and that \u2019s the kind of thing that  happens during a long cycle when there aren \u2019t downturns for , now , into our 11th year.  You get \u2014you know, you do get that kind of phenomenon in a long cycle. So that \u2019s something we \u2019re monitoring, and I think our view still is that that\u2019 s a real issue, but what it really represents is a potential amplifier of a macroeconomic downturn.  It does  not have the makings of anything that w ould undermine the workings of the  financial system, for example, or itself create a shock that would turn the economy down.  It \u2019s more of \u2014it\u2019 s more of an amplifier.  We take it very seriously , though, and, you know, we \u2019re monitoring it carefully. We\u2019re actually looking \u2014the Financial Stability Board is actually conducting a project right now to identify where these loans are held all around the world.  So it\u2019 s the subject of a lot of study and work, and, you know, we \u2019re trying to keep on top of it.\n\nSeptember 18, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nGREG ROBB.  Thank you, Chairman Powell.  Greg Robb from Market Watch.  I \u2019m kind of hearing two things from you.  You\u2019 re saying that the economy is doing well, but there \u2019s this sense with people that the economy is actually s tarting to slow now .  And people are \u2014more and more , you talk\u2014there \u2019s talk  about recession, so you\u2014and even the F ed thinks the downside risks are rising.  So is the economy over  the next year \u2014between now and the end of next year , do you think GDP growth is going to hold s teady , and the unemployment rate \u2014could you talk about , just , how do you see the economy evolving over the next year? CHAIR POWELL.  You know, so, I think\u2014 and my colleagues and I , I think, all think that the most likely case is for continued moderate growth, continued strong labor market, and inflation moving back up to 2 percent.  And I think that \u2019s, by the way, widely shared among forecasters.  You know, the issue is more the risks to that.  You have downside risks here, and we\u2019ve talked about them.  It \u2019s that global growth will have an effect on U.S. growth over time \u2014 less so than for many other economies, but , still, there \u2019s a sector of our economy that \u2019s exposed to that.  Tra de policy uncertainty also has \u2014apparently has an effect.  So \u2014and you can see some weakness in the U.S. economy because of all that.  But , nonetheless \u2014so the job of monetary policy is to adjust both to e nsure against  those downside risks , but also to support the economy in light of the existing weakness that we do see.  So we \u2019re not \u2014as I mentioned , we\u2019re not \u2014we don\u2019t see a recession.  We\u2019 re not forecasting a recession.  But we are adjusting monetary policy in a more accommodative direction to try to support what is , in fact , a favorable outlook. GREG ROBB.  And the invert ed yield curve that we hear  is the b ond market signaling recession \u2014what do you\u2014is that\u2014so that \u2019s not \u2014that signal is not pe rtinent to you ?  Or where do you\u2014\n\nSeptember 18, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nCHAIR POWELL.  No, we do \u2014so we monitor the yield curve carefully,  along with a large , wide range of financial conditions.  We don\u2019t \u2014so, it\u2019s not \u2014there \u2019s no one thing that is dispositive among all financial conditions.  The yield curve is something that we follow carefully.  And, again, based on our assessment of all the data, we still think it \u2019s a positi ve outlook.  The thing\u2014so , just to talk about the current situation, you see \u2014you saw long- term rates move down a whole lot and then retrace two -thirds of that move in the space of a few days. So I think what really matters for all financial conditions gen erally is when there are changes\u2014 material changes that are sustained for a period of time. So\u2014but why are long -term rates low?  There are a number \u2014there can be a signal about expectations about growth there for sure, but there can also just be low  term premiums.  For example, just \u2014well, it can just be that there \u2019s this large quantity of negative -yielding and very low-yielding sovereign debt around the world, and, inevitably , that \u2019s exerting downward pressure on U.S. sovereign rates without really ne cessarily having an independent signal. Nonetheless, that is a signal about weak global growth, probably, and weak global growth would affect us.  So global capital markets and the global economy are quite integrated, so this is something we  pay careful \u2014we\u2019re not going to be dismissive about the yield curve, but \u2014and I think you can tell, on the C ommittee , there \u2019s a range of views \u2014there are some who are very focused on the yield curve, others not so much.  You know, from my perspective, you watch it careful ly, and, you know, I think you need to be asking yourself a lot of questions if the yield curve is inverted as to why that is and how long it \u2019s sustained. PAUL KIERNAN.  Hi , Chairman Powell.  Paul Kiernan from Dow Jones Newswires. You mentioned trade poli cy being a complex, ongoing discussion.  What is your rule for stopping as far as interest rate cuts go?  You refer red to this as a \u201c midcycle adjustment. \u201d  The\n\nSeptember 18, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nmedian dot suggest s no more rate cuts, but, you know, if we get continued kind of back- and- forth  between the U.S. and China, trade policy uncertainty is going to remain heightened.  So, you know, under what circumstances would you say, \u201cY ou know what, I think we \u2019ve cut enough, we stop now \u201d?  And, secondly, as leader of this institution, have you felt  a need to take any steps to boost , like , employee morale at a time when the President  is constantly criticizing the F ed?  Thanks. CHAIR POWELL.  You know, I \u2019d love to be able to articulate a simple, straightforward stopping rule, but it \u2019s really just goin g to be when we think we \u2019ve done enough.  A nd, you know, our eyes are open.  We \u2019re watching the situation.  We \u2019ve cut rates twice.  We\u2019 ve moved, really , through the course of this year, as I discussed, and , you know, we see ourselves as taking actions to sustain the expansion and thereby achieve our goals.  And if you look at sort of the things that are happening in the economy, I think I personally see a high value in sustaining the expansion, because we really are reaching \u2014this positive economy is reaching communities that haven\u2019 t been reached in a long time.  There would be great benefit in having that last as long as possible, that\u2019s all.  So I don\u2019 t have a specific stopping rule for you, but I think we \u2019re watching carefully, and there will come a time, I suspect, when we think we \u2019ve done enough, but there may also come a time when the economy worsens, and we would then have to cut more aggressively.  We don\u2019t know.  We \u2019re going to be watching things caref ully.  The incoming data and the evolving situation and \u2014that \u2019s what \u2019s going to guide our \u2014guide us on that path. In terms of the morale of the institution, I would say it \u2019s very high.  We \u2019re very unified. We feel like we\u2019 re doing the best job we can in ser ving the American people. HANNAH LANG.  Hi, Chairman.  Hannah Lang with American Banker.   It\u2019s been reported that the CFPB is investigating Bank of America for opening unauthorized accounts.\n\nSeptember 18, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nI\u2019m wondering if the Fed is also investigating this a nd, given the pending order against Wells Fargo , if you\u2019 re concerned that these banks are too big to man age. CHAIR POWELL.  You know, so I saw the headline , like, this morning during all of the preparation and everything and this morning\u2019 s meeting.  I really don \u2019t have anything for you on that.  I will say about Wells Fargo that, you know, there were quite wide breakdowns in risk management which resulted in, you know, mistreatment of consumers that we know was quite harmful to the consumers and to the image o f the institution.  I have no idea whether that \u2019s what happened at Bank of America .  I really don \u2019t know , standing here today. STEVEN BECKNER.  Steve  Beckner filing for NPR,  freelance.  The Fed and your fellow central banks have been sort of exploring the far reaches of what \u2019s possible for monetary policy, even going so far as to make rates negative in some cases, with mixed results. Meanwhile, fiscal and regulatory, not to mention trade , policy are pursuing their own separate courses.  As you and your col leagues do this monetary policy framework review, do you ever consider the limitations of monetary policy?  Should you be more explicit about what monetary policy can and cannot do in this environment? CHAIR POWELL.  You know, we try to be clear about that , but, really, I think our job is to use our tools as best we can to achieve\u2014you know , to do the jobs that Congress has assigned us, which is achieve maximum employment and stable prices.  That \u2019s our real job. In terms of  giving the fiscal authorities \u2014who , by the w ay, are the ones who created us\u2014 advice about how to do their job, you know, we kee p that at a high level, I think.  A nd, at a high level, yes, I would say, and I \u2019ve said before, that it \u2019s really fiscal policy that is more powerful and that has muc h more to do with\u2014fiscal policy can do those things that will increase the longer -run growth rate of the United States by improving productivity and labor force\n\nSeptember 18, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nparticipation and the skills and aptitudes of workers.  All of that comes from the private sect or, but also from more of the kinds of things that can be done with fiscal policy. Over the long run, we can\u2019 t really affect the growth rate of the United States .  The potential growth rate of the United States  is not a function of monetary policy.  It \u2019s a function of other things.  So I \u2014I try to be clear about that , and so \u2014but , ultimately, fiscal \u2014fiscal authorities will do what they seem \u2014deem appropriate. SAMIRA HUSSAIN.  Samira Hussain, BBC News.  Mr. Trump has been a very vocal critic of you and your col leagues, recently calling you \u201c boneheads \u201d and just now has called you a \u201cterrible communicator. \u201d  How do you respond to these criticisms ?  And any regrets to have this many press conferences? CHAIR POWELL.  I don \u2019t.  I\u2019m not going to change my practice her e today of not responding to comments or addressing comments made by elected officials.  I will just say that I continue to believe that the independence of the Federal Reserve from direct political control has served the public well over time.  A nd I assu re you that my colleagues and I will continue to conduct monetary policy without regard to political considerations.  We \u2019re going to use our best judgment based on facts, evidence, and objective analysis in pursuing our goals, and that \u2019s what I have to say  on it. BRIAN CHEUNG.  Hi, Chairman Powell.  Brian Cheung with Yahoo Finance.  Thanks for taking my question.  As we saw with falling yields , at least up until the beginning of this month, there \u2019s been a lot of demand for U.S. Treasuries, and even that was  partly maybe to blame for the liquidity crunch in  repo markets that we saw this week.  I mean, does the F ed have concerns over the impacts of a global glut for U.S. debt ?  Is that a conversation that you also\n\nSeptember 18, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nhave with Treasury S ecretary Mnuchin \u2014about wha t the proper way to maybe address some of the challenges down the road with that type of , kind of , heavy interest globally? CHAIR POWELL.  Not really, no.  That\u2019s really \u2014that \u2019s really Treasury \u2019s job and Congress \u2019s job, in terms of, well, there \u2019s how much to spend, and how big the deficits are , and then there \u2019s how to finance it.  And, you know, none of that really calls for advice from t he Fed. We take\u2014we take fiscal policy pretty much as exogenous to our work.  Now, that doesn\u2019 t stop us, from time to tim e, from saying that we think it \u2019s important that the U.S. fiscal picture return to a sustainable footing, and, you know, right now it \u2019s not.  That \u2019s been the case for a long time, and that \u2019s something we will have to address, and a good time to do it is when the economy is strong.  So we limit ourselves to high- level statements like that. HEATHER LONG.  Hi, Heather Long from the Washington Post .  Mr. Chairman, in your view, is there any risk to the United States having much higher interest rates than Europe  and Japan and other parts of the world?  Is there any risk to the U.S. economy to that divergence or any risk to the global economy? CHAIR POWELL.  Yes, so I guess I would say it this way.  Global capital markets are highly integ rated, and, you know, our rates\u2014our long rates are definitely being pulled down by the very, very low rates that are abroad.  And, you know, the way I would characterize it is this : that low rates abroad are a symbol \u2014or a sign, rather, of weak global growth, e xpectations of low inflation, low growth, and, you know, just kind of a lack of policy space to move against or ideas about how to break out of that low equilibrium.  Now, that has implications for us.  You know, we\u2014in a world where economies and financial markets are tightly integrated, that matters for the U.S. economy.  So that \u2019s going to pull down U.S. rates, and U.S. financial conditions can tighten because of that.  And so I think we put all \u2014all of that goes into our thinking and into our\n\nSeptember 18, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nmodels.  We do understand how the \u2014you know, how the international sector interfaces with the U.S. economy.  We take that into account in setting our interest rate policy.  Thank you very much."

My colleagues at the Federal Reserve and I are dedicated to serving the American people.  We do this by steadfastly pursuing the goals that Congress has given us :  maximum employment and stable prices.  We \u2019re committed to making the best decisions we can based o n facts and objective analysis. Today we decided to lower the interest rates for the third time this year.  We took this step to help keep the U.S. economy strong in the face of global developments and to provide some insurance against ongoing risks.  As I will explain shortly, the policy adjustments we have made since last year are providing \u2014and will continue to provide \u2014meaningful support to the economy.  We believe that mone tary policy is in a good place. The U.S. economy is in its 11th year of expansion, and the baseline outlook remains favorable.  The overall economy is growing at a moderate rate.  Household spending continues to be strong, supported by a healthy job market, rising incomes, and solid consumer confidence.  In contrast, business investment and exports remain weak, and manufacturing output has declined over the past year.  Sluggish growth abroad and trade developments have been weighing on those sectors.  Looking ahead, we continue to expect the economy to expand at a moderate rate, reflecting solid household spending and s upportive financial conditions. The job market remains strong.  The unemployment rate has been near h alf-century lows for a year and a half.  The pace of job gains has eased this year but has remained solid ; we had expected some slowing after last year\u2019s strong pace.  Participation in the labor force by people in their prime working years has been increas ing, a nd wages have been rising, particularly for lower -paying jobs.  People who live and work in low - and middle -income communities tell us that many who have struggled to find work are now getting opportunities to add new and better\n\nOctober 30, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nchapters to their liv es.  This underscores for us the importance of sustaining the expansion so that the strong job market rea ches more of those left behind. Inflation continues to run below our symmetric 2 percent objective.  Over the 12 months through August, total PCE inflation was 1.4 percent and core inflation was 1.8 percent.  Inflation pressures remain muted, and indicators of longer -term inflation expectations are at the lower end of their historic ranges.  We\u2019re mindful  that continued below -target inflation could lead to an unwelcome downward slide in long- term inflation expectations.  However, against the backdrop of a strong economy and supportive monetary policy, we expect inflation will rise to 2 percent. Overall, we  continue to see sustained expansion of economic activity, a strong labor market, and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent objective as most likely.  While this has been our outlook for quite some time, our views about the path of interest rates that wil l best achieve these outcomes have changed significantly over the past year.  As I mentioned, weakness in global growth and trade developments have weighed on the economy and pose ongoing risks. These factors, in conjunction with muted inflation pressures , have led us to lower our assessment of the appropriate level of the federal funds rate over the past year.  In both July and September, we reduced the target rate [range] for the federal funds rate by \u00bc percentage point, and we did so again today, bringi ng the range to 1\u00bd  to 1\u00be percent. The policy adjustments  we\u2019ve made to date will continue to provide significant support for the economy.  Since monetary policy operates with a lag, the full effects of these adjustments on economic growth, the job market, and inflation will be realized over time.   We see the current stance of monetary policy as likely to remain appropriate as long as incoming information about the economy remains broadly consistent with our outlook of moderate economic growth, a strong labor market, and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent objective.  We believe monetary policy\n\nOctober 30, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nis in a good place to achieve these outcomes.  Looking ahead, we \u2019ll be monitoring the effects of our policy actions, along with other information bearing on the out look, as we assess the appropriate path of the target range for the fed funds rate.  Of course, if developments emerge that cause a material reassessment of our outlook, we would respond accordingly.  Po licy is not on a preset course. Let me end with a few  words about our technical monetary policy operations.  In January, we made the key decision to continue to implement monetary policy in an ample -reserves regime.  In that operating framework, we control the federal funds rate primarily by setting our admi nistered rates, not through frequent interventions to actively manage the supply of reserves. In the transition to the efficient and effective level of reserves in this regime, we slowed the gradual decline in our balance sheet in March and we stopped it in July. In response to the funding pressures in money markets that emerged in mid- September, we concluded that it would be  appropriate to maintain , over a time \u2014over time , a level of reserve balances at or above the level that prevailed in early September of this year.  To achieve this ample level, we announced on October 11 that we would purchase Treasury bills at least into the second quarter of next year as well as conti nue temporary open market  opera tions at least through January. These actions are purely technical measures to support the effective implementation of monetary policy as we continue to learn about the appropriate level of reserves.  They do not represent a change in the stance of monetary policy.  In particular, our Treasury bill purchases should not be confused with the large -scale asset purchase programs that we deployed after the financial crisis.  In those programs, we purchased longer -term securities to  put downward pressure on longer -term interest rates and ease broader financial conditions.  In contrast,\n\nOctober 30, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nincreasing the supply of reserves by purchasing Treasury bills only alters the mix of short -term assets held by the public and should not materially a ffect demand and supply for longer -term securities or financial conditions more broadly. Thank you.  I will be happy to take your questions. MICHAEL MCKEE.  Michael McK ee with Bloomberg Radio and Television.  So I guess the question is , is this it?  Do you consider rates to be accommodative enough now to achieve your goal of sustaining the expansion?  And as  far as global Wall Street\u2019 s primary question, what kind of change in the economy would cause you to reassess \u2014some sort of sig nificant deterioration in what? CHAIR POWELL.  So what we \u2019ve said, to repeat , is that we see the current stance of policy as \u201c likely to remain appropriate as long as incoming information about the economy remains broadly consistent with our outlook.\u201d   And we say that, really, becau se both of the performance of the economy and the stance of policy.  The performance of the economy has been \u2014particularly the household sector \u2014has been strong, has been resilient , with low unemployment, attractive levels of job creation, wages moving up, l abor force participation moving up, household confidence, and solid gains in many measures of consumer spending.  The manufacturing sector, particularly manufacturing , and also investment and exports have been weaker.  But, overall, we \u2019ve seen moderate gro wth, a strong labor market, inflation moving up. We see the outlook a s for more of the same.  We also see the risks to the outlook as perhaps having moved in a positive direction over the course of this intermeeting  period, although, some remain \u2014some things remain to be seen.  So that \u2019s the economy. Turning to policy, we \u2019ve moved the stance of policy over  the course of the year to a more accommodative stance, and , after the cuts a t the last three meetings, the federal funds r ate is now\n\nOctober 30, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nin a range between 1 \u00bd and 1\u00be percent .  We feel that policy is well positioned to support the outlook that I described.  So you asked what it would take, you know, to move, and, as I mentioned, we \u2019re going to be watching all factors ,  And if developments emerge that c ause a material reassessment of our outlook, we would respond accordingly.  But that \u2019s what it would take:  a materi al reassessment of our outlook. MICHAEL MCKEE.  If I could follow up\u2014i f the markets decide that you need to cut rates again , will you be for ced to follow? CHAIR POWELL.  We\u2019ll be looking at a full range of data about the economy and about the risks to the outlook, and I \u2019ve given you a sense of what our outlook is.  It\u2019 s for moderate growth, a strong labor market, and inflation near our 2 perce nt objective.  If something happens to cause us to materially reassess that outlook, that \u2019s what would cause us to change our views on the appropriate stance of policy. HEATHER LONG.  Hi, Heather Long from the Washington Post .  You just said that the risks to the outlook are moving in a positive direction.  I\u2019m wondering if you could specify\u2014is that on trade , or are there other matters?   This morning we obviously learned that we \u2019ve now had two quarters of contracting business investment , which would seem to be moving the outlook in the other direction. CHAIR POWELL.  So , in terms of risks, what I was referring to there \u2014the principal risks that we \u2019ve been monitoring have been, really , slowing global growth  and trade policy developments  as well as muted inflat ion pressure.  So  I was really referring there to trade developments.  We have that phase -one potential agreement with China, which, if signed and put into effect , could have the effect of reducing trade tensions and re ducing uncertainty, and that would bode well, we think, for business confidence and perhaps activity over time.  So  that has\n\nOctober 30, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nthe potential for being an improvement in the risk picture.   Brexit , I would say, as well \u2014it appears that the risk of a no -deal Brexit seems to have materially declined.  I think on both situations there \u2019s plenty of risk left, but I\u2019 d have to say that t he risks seem to have subsided. You asked  about business investment, and that \u2019s right.  Business investment has been weak , and t oday \u2019s reading was weak as well .  And it was broad acro ss equipment and other parts of\u2014all parts of business fixed investment were weak.  That \u2019s consistent with what we \u2019ve seen, but that \u2019s the economy we \u2019ve had this year.  What we \u2019ve had is an economy where the consumer is really driving growth , and, you know, personal consumption expenditures were almost 3 percent  in this quarter \u2014in this first reading for the quarter.  So, overall, we see the economy as having been resilient to the \u2014you know, the winds that have been blowing this year. HEATHER LONG.  Can I just follow up quickly?  I mean , there \u2019s this concern that I sometimes hear that , with business , businesses have cut investment , and are they going to turn around and cut employment?  You know, sort of , if they continue to be concerned.  Can  you give a sense of how the C ommittee is thinking\u2014thi nking through that possibility? CHAIR POWELL.  Yes, so that is a risk.  That \u2019s a risk that we\u2019 ve been monitoring, but we don\u2019 t see it yet.  We don\u2019 t see rising initial claims or layoffs or anything like that.  But the risk you mention of the weakness in the manufacturing\u2014 in export investment , business investment , parts of the economy getting into the consumer side of the economy, we really don \u2019t see that. What we continue to see is good job creation.  U nemployment has declined again, and the household survey is now at a 50- year low \u2014has been, you know, very close to 50- year low s for 18 months now.  So it \u2019s very positive.  The consumer -facing companies that we talk to in our vast network of contacts report, you know, that consumers are doing well and are focused on,\n\nOctober 30, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nyou know, the good job market and rising incomes, and that \u2019s their principle focus.  So that is the thing that \u2019s pushing the economy forward, and it doesn\u2019 t seem to have been affected so far by weakness in the other areas. JEANNA SMIALEK.  Jeanna Smialek from the New York Times.  Thanks for taking our questions.  So you\u2019 ve previously sort of  compared this rate -cutting cycle to the insurance cuts in the \u201990s, and in both of those instances, the Greenspan F ed took those cuts back after a while. They raised rates again fairly quickly.  And I guess I \u2019m just curious what the onus is for doing that in this cycle.  Wh at would make you guys decide it \u2019s appropriate to raise interest rates again? CHAIR POWELL.  So the reason why we raised interest rates is because \u2014generally is because we see inflation as moving up \u2014or, in danger of moving up significantly, and we really don\u2019t see that now.  Inflation moved down in the first quarter of this year.  We thought that that was due , to some extent , to idiosyncratic or transient  factors.   That turns out to have been the case, so it \u2019s moved back up.  But it seems to be settling in below 2  percent .  So we really don\u2019 t see that risk . And inflation expectations have also kind of moved down and sideways \u2014both surveys and market based over the course of this \u2014of, really , the recent mont hs.  And, you know, we think that inflation expectations are very important in driving actual inflation, and we \u2019re strongly committed to achieving our 2 percent  inflation objective on a symmetric basis.   We think it \u2019s essential that we do that. So we \u2019re not thinking about raising rates right now.  There obviously will be times in the future where that will be appropriate.  What we \u2019re really thinking now is that our current stance\n\nOctober 30, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nof policy is appropriate and will remain so as long as the outlook is broadly in  keeping with our expectations. STEVE LIESMAN.  Mr. \u2014Steve Liesman, CNBC.  Mr. Chairman, I \u2019m\u2014not to make light of it, but I \u2019m a little bit\u2014 I wonder if you could help me out with the appropr iate understanding of the word \u201cappropriate\u201d  here.  S o the statement says  that the Committee  is going \u201cto monitor the implications of incoming information for the outlook as it assesses the appropriate path of the target range. \u201d  That tells me you could go either way.  You  came in , and you used the word \u201c appropr iate,\u201d that the current rate is \u201clikely to remain appropriate ,\u201d which means you\u2019 re on hold.  So how do I walk away from this, and what should we walk away from this believing what \u201c appropriate \u201d means?  Are you on hold and need to be proved wrong that you should rem ain on hold, or is it , really , you could go either way here?  Thank you. CHAIR POWELL.  So we think that the current stance of policy is likely to remain appropriate \u2014likely to remain appropriate \u2014as long as incoming information about the economy is broadly consistent with our outlook, which is a positive one of moderate economic growth, strong labor market, and inflation moving close to 2 percent .  That\u2019s\u2014so that \u2019s what we\u2019 re saying about that.  We also say, of course, if developments emerge that cause a  material reassessment of that outlook, we would respond accordingly.  So that \u2019s really how we \u2019re thinking about it.  I can \u2019t point to one data point or one thing that would change our minds.  It really \u2014it would be a reassessment of \u2014a material reassessment  of our overall outlook, which is what I described. STEVE LIESMAN.  I \u2019m sorry, just  to\u2014why isn\u2019 t the phrase \u201clikely to remain appropriate\u201d  in the statem ent if that\u2019 s the sense of the C ommittee?\n\nOctober 30, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nCHAIR POWELL.  Well, there\u2019s \u2014there \u2019s a lot of, you know, pract ice and science and history , in terms of how much you put in the actual postmeeting statement as opposed to what we say in the  press conference statement.  It\u2019 s a\u2014you know, it \u2019s a judgment call.  You know, I \u2019m saying it now, so \u2014 STEVE LIESMAN.  Thanks. NICK TIMIRAOS.  Thank you.  Nick Timiraos with the Wall Street Journal .  You described the recent sl ide, Chair Powell, in inflation expectations as \u201cunwelcome. \u201d  You said that inflation expectations are \u201cvery important .\u201d  What, if anything, would the C ommittee be prepared to do to address this slide in inflation expectations if it continued? CHAIR POWELL.  So, as I mentioned, we do think that inflation expectations are \u2014 they\u2019 re quite essential, quite central in our framework of how we think about inflati on.  We need them to be anchored in a level \u2014at a level that \u2019s consistent with our symmetric 2  percent inflation goal.   And we think that we need to conduct policy in a way that supports that outcome. That\u2019s what we \u2019re doing now. We\u2019re also, as part of our  review, looking at potential innovations, changes to the way we think about things, changes to the framework that would lead us \u2014that would be more supportive of achieving inflation on a 2 percent \u2014on a symmetric 2  percent  basis over time. That\u2019s at the ve ry heart of what we \u2019re doing in the review.  It \u2019s too early to be announcing decisions.  We haven \u2019t made them yet .  But we \u2019re in the middle of thinking about ways that we can make that symmetric 2  percent  inflation objective more credible by achieving symmetric 2 percent  inflation.  And it comes down to using your policy tools to achieve 2 percent  inflation, and that is the \u2014that is the  thing that must happen for credibility in this area.  So we \u2019re committe d to doing that.\n\nOctober 30, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nNICK TIMIRAOS.  How soon do you think that review mi ght be announced to the public? CHAIR POWELL.  So we \u2019re in the middle \u2014we \u2019re really quite in the middle of it now, and my thinking is still that it will run into the middle of next year.  These are\u2014you know, these changes to monetary policy frameworks happen \u2014they don\u2019 t happen really quickly, let \u2019s say. Inflation targeting took many years to evolve.  I don\u2019 t think we \u2019ll take many years here.  I think we\u2019ll wrap it up around the middle of ne xt year , would be my guess.  I  have some confidence in that. EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Edward Lawrence of Fox Business.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking this.  So how big of a change, then, to monetary policy would there be if you get some of that uncertainty cleared up \u2014specifically , the phase -one China trade deal finished and  USMCA ratified?  How big of a change could that be to the monetary policy as it stands here, and could we see rate cuts next year \u2014or, rate hikes next year ?  I\u2019m sorry. CHAIR POWELL.  Rate hikes for next year . EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Yes , because I \u2019ve heard the argument that t rade\u2019s causing the uncertainty.  U ncertainty is keeping the prices low.  I \u2019ve heard that argument from a F ed president from one of the D istricts.  So you remove that uncerta inty, prices, then, would naturally rise.  So could there be a point, or how \u2014I guess my question is , how big of an impact on monetary policy would removing that uncertainty  be? CHAIR POWELL.  Yes.  So I would just say that a\u2014if we were  to have a sustained reduction in trade tensions \u2014broad reduction in trade tensions and a resolution of these uncertainties, that would bode well for business sentiment , which is \u2014trade uncertainty \u2019s been weighing on business sentiment, in our judgment, in the judgment of many a nalysts.  And,\n\nOctober 30, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nultimately, it could affect activity.   I wouldn\u2019 t expect that the effects on activity or confidence would be immediate , or\u2014wo uld there  be immediate effects i n economic activity.  I think it would take some time after the recent things, but I do think it would be quite positive over time. You come back to the question of raising rates .  So that \u2019s really about inflation .  And you know, we haven\u2019 t yet\u2014we just touched 2 percent  core i nflation , to pick one measure \u2014just touched it for a few months, and then we \u2019ve fallen back.  So I think we would need to see a really significant move up in inflation that \u2019s persistent before we would consider raising rates to address inflation concerns. BRENDAN GREELEY.  Brendan Greeley, the Financial Times .  The other thing you \u2019ve talked about in this review is the gains that a super high- pressure labor market have, particularly for the communities that you\u2019 re talking about.  You mentioned it just now whe n you were talking.   If that \u2019s something that you\u2019 re identifying , and that \u2019s something that the Fe d is learning more about this year, why not continue to push those gains, particularly for people who are reentering the labor force? CHAIR POWELL.  Well, I think we \u2019re doing that.  I mean, I think we \u2019re keeping\u2014I think we \u2019ve made very substantial adjustments to polic y over the course of this year , if you think about it.  We entered the year expecting some further rate increases, w e went  to \u201cpatient ,\u201d now we\u2019ve done three rate cuts.  It\u2019s a very substantial shift, and the effects of it will be felt over time. So we feel like those shifts are appropriate to support exactly the outcomes you\u2019 re talking about, which are a continuing strong labor market, continued strong job creation. BRENDAN GREELEY.  So if you were to d escribe the shifts that you \u2019ve made so far, it wasn \u2019t just about trade uncertainty.  It was about , specifically , these kinds of high- pressure labor gains that you\u2019 ve talked about.\n\nOctober 30, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nCHAIR POWELL.  Well, no.  It was \u2014so we \u2019ve said it was about three things.  It \u2019s been about the slowing global economy.  You have a synchronized slowdown in economic activity around the globe.  It \u2019s been building for just about 18 months now, and that \u2019s having an effect on U.S. activity.  That \u2019s part of the weakness in manufacturing, export , and business investment. We\u2019ve had trade policy uncertainty, which we think also has been weighing on activity and investment and sentiment.  And we \u2019ve had inflation, which\u2014we \u2019ve called  out the risk of inflation running persistently below 2 percent  as a risk that we needed to address.  So we \u2019ve been doing it to address all of those things. I would say,  the gains in the labor market have been great to see.  It \u2019s particularly the fact that people at the lower end of wages have been getting most of the benefit of most of the wage gains in the last couple of years.  That \u2019s a great thing.  You know from our Fed Listens  events that we \u2019ve been hearing from people who live and work in low - and moderate -income communities that this is the best labor market they \u2019ve seen in their lifetime , things like that . And, by the way, that there \u2019s also \u2014there \u2019s still so many people who are, you know, still not in the labor market yet,  and that \u2014there \u2019s just a lot more good that can be done there.  At the same time, we have to think about the whole economy, and\u2014but , yes, those gains are very positive.  We do call them out.  They are a reason for us to want to extend the expansion, and that\u2019s something we \u2019re committed to doing. VICTORIA GUIDA.  On the Fed\u2019s balance sheet \u2014you all  recently resumed purchases of Treasury bills, and I was just wondering, how long do you expect that to continue ?  And, given the fact that, you know, the repo operations \u2014it seems like the F ed is having to increase the amount of liquidity\u2014 temporary liquidity that it \u2019s injecting into the system.  You know, do you\n\nOctober 30, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nstill feel like it\u2019 s just \u2014that there is not enough reserves in the system ?  Do you feel like you have a good sense of what \u2019s going on there? CHAIR POWELL.  Okay.  So, on the \u201c how long,\u201d  what we \u2019ve said is that we expect bill purchases to continue at least into the second quarter of next year.  And we \u2019ve said that temporary open market operations we expect to continue, I think, at least until the end of January, I believe.  Yes , through January. In terms of the causes, so there \u2019s a lot of forensic work going on by us and by market participants and all kinds of analysts.  And, you know, one thing is that we t hink we need reserves to be back up to the level \u2014the minimum level of reserves that we can have during the various fluctuations that you see with reserves is something like $1.45 trillion or a little higher, and that \u2019s the level in early September.  So we \u2019re going to be adding reserves to get back to that place.  That \u2019s one thing. There are also \u2014it may be \u2014one thing that was surprising about the episode was that liquidity didn \u2019t seem to flow as one might have expected.  We had surveyed the banks carefully about what was their lowest comfortable level of reserves, and many banks that were well above that level did not take that excess cash and invest it in the repo market at much higher rates. They just \u2014they didn\u2019 t do tha t, and so the question is why.  A nd are there things that we can do that would \u2014adjustments that we could make that would allow liquidity to flow more easily in the system without in any way sacrificing safety and so undness or financial stability?  So we \u2019re looking at those.  Those are not things that can happen that can really address the situation in the short term, but those are a range of things that we \u2019re looking at as well. HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Howard Schneider with Reuters, and thanks for the questions. I wonder if you could give us a little more texture on, sort of , what the strongest or most\n\nOctober 30, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nimportant case is for feeling that you\u2019 ve now taken out  adequate insurance.  Is it the response you\u2019re seeing in housing and other parts of the economy, arguably, to the cuts made so far?   Is it the fact that the risk environment out there globally has shifted a bit and abated a bit?   Or is it something different, you know, in the financial markets, the fact that the yield curve has righted itself, et c etera? CHAIR POWELL.  Honestly, it \u2019s really the\u2014there isn \u2019t any one factor.   It\u2019s really the whole range of economic data and also what we see as\u2014about our stance of policy, which we believe is the appropriate stance.  It \u2019s really both of those things.  Again, if you look at the performance of the economy thr ough this, the consumer sector has  been quite resilient.  Witness today\u2019 s GDP report.  And it \u2019s just \u2014again, all the things I went through earlier suggest that that sector continues to be strong.  We know that the manufa cturing, investment , trade , export  sector has been weak.  That continues, but nonetheless, overall, we \u2019ve got an economy that is showing moderate growth, and we think that today\u2019 s setting \u2014we\u2019re now  at 1.5 to 1.75 percent .  That is, we believe, an accommodative level and a level that wi ll support that outlook that we  have. HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  But are you concerned\u2014just to follow up , really .  This is kind of a one -legged recovery, that unless you get some impetus from other  things \u2014exports, investment \u2014tha t it\u2019s going t o weaken further at some point? CHAIR POWELL.  You know, we don\u2019 t see any evidence of that.  What we see is\u2014 what we see is that the consumer sector continues strong.  Agai n, low initial claims.  It\u2019 s all\u2014the data we monit or, obviously, is a very broad range of data.  We also see now, I think, more clearly the effects of more accommodative monetary policy on various kinds of consumer activity.  You \u2019re seeing strong durable goods sales.  You \u2019re seeing housing now contributing to growth for the first time in a while \u2014two-tenths, I think , this quarter.  And you\u2019 re seeing retail sales\u2014 the retail\n\nOctober 30, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nsales number, the PCE number, as I mentioned, in today\u2019 s release was 2.9  percent .  So that \u2019s good.  A nd I think, more broadly, monetary policy is also supporting household spending and home  buying by keeping the labor market strong, keeping workers \u2019 incomes rising, and keeping consumer confidence at high levels , where it currently is. SCOTT HORSLEY.  Thank you, Mr . Chairman .  You were just talking about how t he lower rates have affected consumer behavior .  Is there a concern that there \u2019s just less potency on the business investment side that you\u2019 re, in effect, pushing on a string? CHAIR POWELL.  Well , I think monetary policy works  through the channels that we understand.  I think the effects are clear in what we think of as the interest- rate-sensitive sectors, which are the ones\u2014some of the ones that I mentioned.  I think it \u2019s\u2014I think interest rates are a factor in business investment, but I don\u2019 t believe they \u2019re the main factor and main driver .  And I think, you know, what one would like to see for \u2014to support greater manufacturing activity, business investment, and exports would be a global recovery .  And, you know, there \u2019s a lot of monetary policy accommodation and some fiscal  accommodation , maybe , in the global economy now.  Not here, but perhaps elsewhere.  And that should turn \u2014that should support growth in the global economy.  A nd, again, resolution of our trade issues would contribute to that over time as well. CHRIS RUGABER.  Thank you.  Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.  You mentioned Fed Listens a couple  of times, and what you\u2019 ve heard from people there about how it \u2019s benefited  the disadvantaged or lower -income workers \u2014the h ot job market we have.  Has the F ed thought about institutionalizing something like Fed Listens  and maybe taking in some of this input from people that you don\u2019 t alw ays hear from \u2014things like the Beige B ook focus on\n\nOctober 30, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nbusinesses ?  Has there been thought of bringing in folks, say, from com munity groups more regularly?  Thank you. CHAIR POWELL.  We think\u2014we think that Fed Listens  has been a great success for us, and I \u2019m sure we will repeat it .  In fact, I would imagine that this entire monetary policy review will become institutionalized and be done every few years.  I would say this :  In the Beige B ook, we talk to educational institutions, health -care institutions, community groups, labor groups \u2014it\u2019s not just businesses.  And, by the way, all of those groups are also represented on the boards of our regional banks . We al so meet quite regularly at the B oard with representatives of low - and moderate - income communities .  And so we\u2019re \u2014we \u2019re very conscious of \u2014you know, that we represent all Americans, and we need to hear all of their perspect ives.  That \u2019s why we \u2014you know, we talk about how low the unemployment rate is, the aggregate unemployment, but we also talk about groups that haven\u2019 t experienced that yet .  And so we\u2019re \u2014we try to remind ourselves that we serve everybody . STEVE MATTHEWS.  Steve Matthews with Bloomberg .  You mentioned housing and today\u2019 s GDP data .  When you look at that, do you believe that you have achieved a soft landing or are achieving a soft landing, in the sense that we\u2019 re moving to trend growth for the rest of the year and next year? CHAIR POWELL.  So that is \u2014our outlook overall is for moderate growth of around 2 percent , which is pretty close to trend .  That \u2019s our outlook :  could be better , could be worse . You know, it \u2019s\u2014you never say you\u2019 ve achieved it .  But that\u2019 s our outlook.  A nd we feel like our current stance of policy is appropriate as long as that remains broadly our outlook.\n\nOctober 30, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nDONNA BORAK.  Donna Borak with CNN.  Chair Powell, setting aside market expectations for today\u2019 s rate cut \u2014obviously, 97 percent  sort of expected that this would happen today\u2014can you tell us a little bit more about the rationale behind moving at this particular meeting as opposed to waiting six weeks and cutting in December , and if there was any discussion about that around the tab le?  Thanks . CHAIR POWELL.  Yes.  I think this seems to be the right movement .  You can see that we had our usual range of perspectives, range of views .  But, in the end, we had a strong vote in favor of this action.  I strongly believe it \u2019s the right acti on.  I strongly believe that the actions we\u2019ve taken over the course of this year have been the right things to do for this economy and are supporting economic growth and will do so in the future .  So\u2014 GREG ROBB.  Thank you.  Greg Robb from MarketWatch.  C hairman Powell, it seems that the differences all across the country \u2014that different regions are reacting differently to the China trade, and some regions are much weaker than others.  There \u2019s this urban versus rural divide , the coasts versus the middle of the country .  How does that factor into your policy decisions ? CHAIR POWELL.  You know, it \u2019s\u2014monetary policy is famously a blunt instrument .  So we can \u2019t\u2014obviously, we can\u2019 t raise interest rates some place and lower them other places.  But we\u2019re very conscious .  The first thing to know is to understand that , that\u2014and we \u2019ve called that out, as you, I\u2019m sure , know, in one of our recent Monetary Policy Report s to Congress .  The sort of rural \u2013urban disparities in \u2014you know, in employment, in growth, in all kinds of things, in health outcomes.  You know, i t\u2019s a big and growing difference \u2014set of differences.  We don\u2019 t really have, you know, the tools to address that, but we call things out that are important to our economy that we may not be \u2014that we might have \u2014may not have the right tools to best address\n\nOctober 30, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nthem, but we call them out because, you know, we \u2019re spending all of our time with the economy, and those are issues that maybe have to be addressed by legislatures and, you know, by\u2014at the national level and at  the state level . GREG ROBB.  Oh, could I follow?  Sorry, could I follow ?  Could\u2014s orry.  Just , so\u2014so are you asking Congress to do something now, or will you ask them  to do something down the road? CHAIR POWELL.  I \u2019m not asking Congress to do anything right now .  I sometimes have noted that it would be appropriate .  Let me p ut it this way :  We do what we do, which is , we\u2019re assigned a job , which is maximum employment and stable prices.  We do financial stability .  We do bank regulation.  The U.S. economy faces significant longer -term challenges around potential growth, around labor force participation, around disparities of income and wealth, around all kinds of things .  And those are issues for Congress, and they\u2019 re not issues for us.  But if you really w ant the U.S. economy to be all it can be and raise the potential growth rate of the United States, you need\u2014you need proper monetary policy.  But, really, it isn \u2019t monetary policy . Really , it\u2019s fiscal policy that supports, you know, inclusive growth. DON LEE.  Don Lee with the L.A. Times .  I think you said, Chair Powell, that the primary positive development in risk s to the outlook was on trade and, specifically, the prospects for a phase -one agreement with China .  But, given the ups and downs of the trade  dispute and that, you know, several truces and tentative deals have fallen through, are you concerned about developing monetary policy guidance, if you will, that \u2019s dependent a  good part on the wins of the trade negotiations ? CHAIR POWELL.  Yes, I know, t hat\u2019s\u2014I wouldn\u2019 t\u2014that \u2019s not how I would characterize it .  I would just \u2014I noted that it may be that there \u2019s been progress there toward \u2014\n\nOctober 30, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\naway from bad outcomes and confrontational outcomes, and it seems like there \u2019s the makings of a possible settlement there.  I didn\u2019 t say we \u2019re baking that in or anything, but I \u2019m just noting that that\u2019s the case.  As with Brexit\u2014 it\u2019s still quite uncertain what will be the result of the election and what the ultimate result will be .  But I would say that the tail risk of a nonnegotiated no- deal Brexit seems to have decreased, just as I would say that the situation in our trade negotiations with China seems to have taken a step closer to resolution .  That \u2019s all I\u2019 m saying. DON LEE.  If I could follow up, if the phase -one agreem ent, then , doesn\u2019 t work out, then would we be back at, you know, making, you know, monetary policy that\u2014 CHAIR POWELL.  That \u2019s one factor among many, many factors that factor into our assessment of the outlook .  And if we see\u2014if we have \u2014if we \u2014if things happen that cause us to materially reassess the outlook, change our assessment of the outlook in a material way, t hen we would act accordingly. VIRGINIE MONTET.  Virginie Montet with the Agence France- Presse.  T hank you. The Fed has pointed out many times in the past the rising inequality over those past decades and how that could be a factor behind sluggish growth.  In light of the recent outcome of the strike at General Motors, do you see the union having a role to play, helping to raise lower and middle incomes and promoting more shared growth in  the long run ? CHAIR POWELL.  So, not for us to say what the appropriate labor arrangements will be . I will just say , on the General Motors strike, it\u2019s \u2014it\u2019 s likely to have taken away a couple of tenths of growth this quarter.  That \u2019s likely to come back , maybe , over the first half of next year . And I think it \u2019s good to see it settled .  But I \u2019m not going to comment on what the appropriate labor arrangements are.  That \u2019s a little bit far afield fro m our task here.  Thank you.\n\nOctober 30, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nPAUL KIERNAN.  Thank you, Chairman.  Paul Kiernan from Dow Jones News wires. [Inaudible ] Oh, I w as wondering what that was .  Paul Kiernan from Dow Jones Newsw ires. Thank you\u2014t hank you, Chairman.  Wondering if you would categorize the current s tance of monetary policy as accommodative, or if it \u2019s just, you know, that neutral was lower than we thought at this time last year.  Secondly, you know, we \u2019re now two years removed from the T ax Cuts and J obs A ct, and the economy is growing at about the same pace it was before \u20142 percent. So, given your mention of fiscal policy and the role it plays in supporting long- term growth, you know, is it fair to say that the T ax Cuts and J obs A ct worked the way it was supposed to? Thanks . CHAIR POWELL.  So rry, say again what your first question was ?  I wrote it down , I can\u2019t\u2014 PAUL KIERNAN.  Sorry \u2014if policy is  accommodative  right now . CHAIR POWELL.  Ah, y es.  Okay .  So if you look at where the federal funds rate is trading , it should be in the middle of , or maybe the lower half of , the range of 150 to 175.  So that means the real rate is probably modestly below zero.  I think my own sense would be that that\u2019s somewhat accommodative policy .  I would say, though, that there \u2019s a range of plausible estimates of what the neutral rate of interest is, and I think many of those who make such estimates have moved their estimate down over the course of many years, and that process continues .  But, nonetheless, that seems to me to be very likely to be an accommodative stance of policy, and an appropriate stance , given the situation we \u2019re in with continuing downside risks and\u2014that I mentioned.  So\u2014 JEAN YUNG.  Hi .  Jean Yung from Market News.  I wanted to ask about financial stability risk s.  Recently, the IMF and some other global policymakers have been expressing\n\nOctober 30, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nconcerns over the high level of risky  corporate debt .  So as rates get lower in the U.S. and around the world, are you more worried about financial stability risk s and reach -for-yield? CHAIR POWELL.  So we monitor financial stability risks very carefully all of the time . It\u2019s what we do since the financial crisis, as I \u2019ve mentioned before .  Currently, we don \u2019t see large imbalances.  This long expansion is notable for the lack of large financial imbalances like the ones we \u2019ve seen certainly before the crisis happened . So we have a four -part framework, I \u2019ll quickly mention .  The first is leverage in the financial system , which  is low by historical standards .  The second is fundi ng risk, which is the risk of runnable funding, and that risk is also quite low for banks but also for, you know, the nonbanking financial sector .  If you look at asset prices, we see some high asset prices but not broadly across a range .  We don\u2019 t see bubbles and  that kind of thing.  And that leaves the fourth, which is leverage in the nonfinancial sector , and that \u2019s households and businesses .  So with households, again, we don\u2019 t see leverage.  We see them actually getting in very good shape financially in  the aggregate.  Obviously, plenty of households are not in great shape financially, but in the aggregate, the household sector  is in a very good place .  That leaves businesses, which is where the issue has been .  Leverage among corporations and other form s of business, private businesses, is historically high.  We \u2019ve been monitoring it carefully and taking appropriate steps . So that\u2019s what I would say, but it \u2019s\u2014corporate debt is one part of a larger part of our framework, and it is something that we \u2019re pay ing quite a bit of attention to .  And it\u2019s been part of the last couple of S hared National C redit exams, and we\u2019 ve been monitoring it carefully and taking appropriate action .\n\nOctober 30, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nNANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  Hi.  Nancy Marshall -Genzer with Marketplace.  Have the pr oblems in the repo market led  you to  look into whether the liquidity and capital requirements for banks are too hi gh?  Is that something that the F ed mig ht review? CHAIR POWELL.  So we \u2019re\u2014I think, again , I think the most important basic thing is to get the  level of reserves back up so that \u2014reserves move up and down with some volatility.  We don\u2019t want them to move below the level they were at in the beginning of September , which is, again, between $1.45 and $1.5 trillion .  That \u2019s the main thing, that \u2019s the first thing .  And we \u2019re on a path to do that , between our temporary open market operations and also our bill purchases . In addition to that \u2014in addition to that, we \u2019re looking at \u2014there are\u2014it \u2019s a big, complicated marketplace, and there was the\u2014one of the surprises, as I mentioned, was that banks that had told us that their lowest comfortable level of reserves was here.  They were well above that, and yet they didn\u2019 t deploy that liquidity when there seemed to be great opportunities to do that .  That didn\u2019 t happen.  So why is that?  And so, we \u2019re doing careful analysis of that . You ask, would we lower capital and liquidity requirements because of this ?  I don \u2019t think so.  I don \u2019t think that\u2019 s where this goes.  I think where it may go, though, is to look at, for example, intraday liquidity, which used to be a common thing.  It used to be a common thing for banks to ha ve intraday liquidity from the F ed, what are called \u201cdaylight overdrafts .\u201d  That \u2019s something we can look at .  Also, there are just a few technical t hings that we can look at that would perhaps make the liquidity that we have \u2014which we think is ample in the financial system \u2014move more freely and be more liquid, if you will .  And those are things we would do, but only if we can do it without compromising safety or soundness or financial stability . NAOATSU AOYAMA.  Thank you very much, Chairman Powell .  Naoatsu Aoyama from the Asahi Shimbun, a Japanese newspaper .  Given this sustained level of low  inflation, even\n\nOctober 30, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nin\u2014even in this country, do you think\u2014so the re seems to be a higher possibility that lower inflation expectation s will remain going forward.  So do you think a Japan -like situation , or \u201cJapanification \u201d of chronically low inflation and interest rates \u2014the U.S. is getting trapped by the Japanification of this situation ?  Do you think so? CHAIR POWELL.  So we \u2014we , of course, have watched the situation in Japan and now the situation in Europe, and we \u2014we note that there are significant disinflationary pressures around the world.  And we don\u2019 t think we \u2019re exempt from those .  But, of course, if you look at our current inflation performance, it hasn\u2019 t been anything like what we \u2019ve seen in those other places.  But we don\u2019 t think \u2014again, we don\u2019 t think we \u2019re exempt from those pressures, and we are, therefore, st rongly committed to having inflation expectations anchored at the level that is consistent with the symmetric 2  percent  inflation objective .  That\u2019s what we \u2019re committed to, and we\u2019ll use our tools to achieve .  So we take \u2014we take the risk very seriously. It\u2019s not \u2014the risk isn \u2019t that inflation might run a couple tenths below 2 percent.  The risk is that what we \u2019ve seen is other economies getting on a disinflationary path, that  it\u2019s been very hard for them to get off .  Once inflation expectations start slidin g down, inflation moves down. You have less \u2014interest rates move down as well , because there\u2019 s an inflation component in interest rates .  And, you know, we think that the right thing to do is to do what we can now to hold and really move inflation expectat ions up so that they\u2019 re squarely and firmly anchored at a level that \u2019s consistent with 2  percent  inflation . BRIAN CHEUNG.  Hi.  Brian Cheung with Yahoo Finance .  Another type of balance sheet question, but not necessarily focused on the repo crunch \u2014there was a discussion before that, that maybe we should move \u2014or, rather, the F ed should move to a more neutral balance sheet, trying to remove some of the agency mortgage -backed securities that are on the balance\n\nOctober 30, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nsheet and maybe replace them with shorter -term T reasuries.  Not any\u2014I haven\u2019 t really heard an update on the composure or  the composition of the balance sheet for right now.  I \u2019m just wondering if the F ed is actively thinking about that right now, and, if so, when we might expect to hear something on that . CHAIR POWELL.  You know, it\u2019s a \u2014it\u2019s an issue, but it \u2019s not an issue that we\u2019 re currently working on and \u2014or reaching a decision on or anything like that .  The question of the longer -run maturity composition of the balance sheet is a \u2014is a  big one, a nd it\u2019s one we \u2019ll return to over time , but not \u2014not  imminently . VIVIENNE NUNIS.  Chairman Powell, this morning, the President tweeted that we \u2019re seeing the greatest economy in American h istory.  I just wondered , as the C hair of America \u2019s central bank , what you made of that characterization . CHAIR POWELL.  You know, I \u2019m going to maintain my longtime  practice of not \u2014not commenting on anything any elected official would say, but thank you. VIVIENNE NUNIS.  Okay, thank you. CHAIR POWELL.  Thanks very much."

To begin, I \u2019d like to say a few words about Paul Volcker, who, as you know , passed away earlier this week.  Paul Volcker served as Federal Reserve Chair from 1979 to 1987.  He accomplished many things during his long and distinguished career at the Fed and elsewhere.  Of course, he\u2019 s best known for leading the fight to tame the d ouble -digit inflation that he inherited as Chair, thus laying the foundation for the prosperity and price stability we enjoy today.  But what is perhaps most admirable about him \u2014 more than his many accomplishments \u2014was his character.  He believed that there is no higher calling than public service, and he dedicated the lion\u2019 s share of his life to it.  With courage, integrity, and tenacity, he always pursued the policies that he believed would ultimately benefit all Americans.  My colleagues and I continue to draw inspiration from his example. Turning to today\u2019 s meeting, my colleagues and I decided to leave our policy rate unchanged after lowering it a total of \u00be percentage point at the previous  three meetings.  As always, we base our decisions on judgment of how best to achieve the goals Congress has given us:  maximum employment and price stability.  Our economic outlook remains a favorable one despite global developments and ongoing risks.  With our decisions through the course of the past year, we believe th at monetary policy is well positioned to serve the American people by supporting continued economic growth, a strong job market, and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent goal. The economic expansion is in its 11th year, the longest on record.  Household spending has been strong, supported by a healthy job market, rising incomes, and solid consumer confidence.  In contrast, business investment and exports remain weak, and manufacturing output has declined over the past year.  As has been the case for some time, sluggish growth\n\nDecember 11, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nabroad and trade developments have been weighing on those sectors.  Even so, the overall economy has been growing moderately.  And with a strong household sector and supportive monetary and financial conditions, we expect moderate growth to continue.  As seen from slightly over the next few years but remains near 2 percent. The unemployment rate has been near half -century lows for well more tha n a year, and the pace of job gains remains solid.  Participation in the labor force by people in their prime working years, ages 25 through 54, has been increasing.  And wages have been rising, particularly for lower- paying jobs.  People who live and work in low - and middle -income communities tell us that many who have struggled to find work are now finding new opportunities.  Employment gains have been broad based across all racial and ethnic groups and all levels of education.  These developments underscore for us the importance of sustaining the expansion so that the strong job market reaches more of those left behind.  We expect the job market to remain strong.  The median of participants \u2019 projections for the unemployment rate remains below 4 percent ov er the next several years. Inflation continues to run below our symmetric 2 percent objective.  Over the 12 months through October, total PCE inflation was 1.3 percent , and core inflation \u2014which excludes volatile food and energy prices and is a better indic ator of future inflation \u2014was 1.6 percent. While low and stable inflation is certainly a good thing, inflation that runs persistently below our objective can lead to an unhealthy dynamic in which longer -term inflation expectations drift down, pulling actua l inflation even lower.  In turn, interest rates would be lower as well and closer to their effective lower bound.  As a result, the scope for interest rate reductions to support the economy in a future downturn would be diminished, resulting in worse economic outcomes\n\nDecember 11, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nfor American families and businesses.  Against the backdrop of a strong economy and supportive monetary policy, we expect inflation will rise to 2 percent.  The median of participants \u2019 projection rises to 1.9 percent next year and 2 percent i n 2021.  We \u2019re strongly committed to achieving our symmetric 2 percent inflation goal. Over the course of the past year, our views about the path of interest rates that would best achieve our employment and inflation objectives changed significantly, as the economy faced some important challenges from weaker global growth and trade developments.  As the year progressed, we adjusted the stance of monetary policy to cushion the economy from these developments and to provide some insurance against the associat ed risks.  In addition, inflation pressures were unexpectedly muted, strengthening the case for a more supportive stance of policy.  Rather than modestly increasing the target rate for the federal funds rate this year , as seemed appropriate a year ago, we reduced it by \u00be percentage point.  This shift has helped support the economy and has kept the outlook on track.  The medians of participants \u2019 projections for economic growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation are little changed from a year ago, aside from a lower inflation projection for 2019.  Of course, that is the function of monetary policy\u2014 to adjust interest rates to promote employment and price stability in response to forces acting on the economy. We believe that the current stance of monetary policy will support sustained growth, a strong labor market, and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent objective.  As long as incoming informat ion about the economy remains broadly consistent with this outlook, the current stance of monetary policy likely will remain appropriate.  Looking ahead, we will be monitoring the effects of our recent policy actions, along with other information bearing on the outlook, as we assess the appropriate path of the target range for the federal funds rate.  Of course, if\n\nDecember 11, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\ndevelopments emerge that cause a material reassessment of our outlook, we would respond accordingly.  Policy is not on a preset course. Finally,  I wanted to note that we \u2019ve been purchasing Treasury bills and conducting repurchase operations, consistent with the plan we announced in December.1  These technical operations are aimed at maintaining an ample level of reserves and addressing money marke t pressures that could adversely affect the implementation of monetary policy.  Our operations have gone well so far; pressures in money markets over recent weeks have been subdued.  To address possible pressures in money markets over the year -end, we \u2019ve been conducting term repo operations spanning year -end.  We stand ready to adjust the details of our operations as appropriate to keep the federal funds rate in the target range.  Thank you, and I \u2019ll be happy to take your questions. HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  [Inau dible  remark ]  Sorry \u2014Howard Schneider with Reuters . Sorry about that.  So I was struck by the , sort of , disconnect that exists here between the behavior of unemployment and inflation.  Y ou seem to have unemployment penciled in here now for three years run ning\u2014more \u2014underneath the longer -run level, yet inflation never really accelerates.  S o what are we to make of that? CHAIR POWELL.  Well , that \u2019s\u2014what \u2019s happening there is the fact that the relationship between resource utilization , or unemployment , and infl ation has just gotten weaker and weaker over the years.  If you go back 50 years , you would have seen that, when there was \u2014when labor markets were tight and unemployment was low, inflation moved right up.  And then as the Fed got control of inflation, the connection got weaker and weaker and weaker, to the point where there \u2019s still a connection, but it\u2019s \u2014it\u2019 s a very faint one.  And I \u2014what that suggests is that you\n\n1 Chair Powell intended to say the repurchase operations were announced in October.\n\nDecember 11, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nwould need to keep policy somewhat accommodative .  And we believe that policy is somewhat accommodative , and we think that that \u2019s the appropriate place for policy to be in order to drive up inflation. HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  If I could f ollow up on that \u2014I mean , it\u2019s faint to nonexistent , though, it seems to me, so this  suggest s that, really , your policy leve r as it exists now isn \u2019t really influencing prices at all.  So , in that case, what do you do to reach your target? CHAIR POWELL.  You know, I don\u2019 t think that\u2019 s right .  I mean, we \u2014the \u2014again , the relationship between slack in the economy and inflation is weak , has been weak.  The coefficient is something like 0.1.  So it \u2019s much, much lower than it used to be , but I don\u2019 t know that it \u2019s gone down any more in the last decade .  It just is quite faint.  But it\u2019 s still there .  I mean , you can see it .  If you look\u2014look at where wages were three  or four  years ago, they were running around 2 percent.  And now the whole group of different wage measures that we monitor has moved up to 3 and 3\u00bd percent , and that suggests tightening.  The same thing is true , but much less true , of inflation, the relationship between \u2014in a way , the wage Phillips curve has a higher coefficient than the price Phillips curve does.  But we do still see some relationship , and that \u2019s what you\u2019 re seeing in those numbers. STEVE LIESMAN .  Mr. Chairman, Steve Liesman CNBC.  You\u2019 ve used the analogy t o 1998 to describe the rate cuts we just went through, and I \u2019m wondering if we can sort of continue the analogy.  Within seven  months of those \u2019 98 rate cuts, t he Fed took them back and then som e. So, were these those kind of rate cuts, the kind that you need to take back, or are we at a place now where we \u2019re at a neutral rate \u2014\u201ctake back ,\u201d I mean if those risks that you say we \u2019re cushioning from don\u2019 t materialize in the way you think\u2014or is this now a new sort of steady state\n\nDecember 11, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nfor the economy at this rate, this is the right rate for the economy that you see going forward and don\u2019t need to take those rate cuts back? CHAIR POWELL.  So there \u2019s similarities, conceptual similarities , I think , between th e two instances during that long expansion, I guess in \u201995 and \u2019 98, when the Fed cut three times only to resume raising rates.  And the notion just is that it \u2019s a\u2014the economy needed slightly more accommodative policy , but it wasn \u2019t the end of the expansion, right?  And that \u2019s the same situation we believe we \u2019re in here.  So this is that we did, in fact , turn out to do three rate cuts . That wasn \u2019t in the plan, you know , in any kind of specific way at the beginning.  So that \u2019s the same. What \u2019s diffe rent is , you have a very different \u2014you have very different structural characteristics in the economy , particularly around inflation.  So now, as you can see , inflation is barely moving up, notwithstanding that unemployment is at 50- year lows and expected t o remain there.  So the need for rate increases is less.  And , by the way, this is \u2014it\u2019s a good thing that , you know, we think we can \u2014I think we \u2019ve learned that unemployment can remain at quite low levels for an extended period of time without unwanted upwa rd pressure on inflation.  In fact, we need some upward pressure o n inflation to get back to 2 percent.  It \u2019s quite different in \u2019 95 and \u2019 98 when there were those two adjustments.  S o, I would say, similarities and differences. MICHAEL MCKEE.  The BIS  conc luded in\u2014 I did the same thing as Howard.  Michael McKee, Bloomberg radio and television.  The BIS concluded in September that the repo spike was not a one -off confluence of random events but reflected structural and regulatory issues that could lead to a r ecurrence.  I \u2019d like to ask you if you agree with the BIS findings . And, given that we \u2019re approaching year -end for the markets , will you be taking any extra steps to ensure that funding is available in the repo and FX swaps markets?   There was a report\n\nDecember 11, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nyesterday  from  Credit Suisse suggesting there \u2019s a good chance that we will see disruptions , and one of the reasons they put for it is that the Fed is at this point buying only T -bills, and the market wants to sell coupons .  Do you have any plans to sell coupons? CHAIR POWELL.  So I \u2019m going to take a little step back, and I will\u2014 I will get to your specific questions on the year -end and on T -bills.  So I guess I want to start by stressing that these are very important operational matters but that are not like ly to have any macroeconomic implications.  We \u2019d decided back in January to remain an ample -reserves regime, and that means we will be setting the federal funds rate \u2014the range for the federal funds rate through our administered rates and not through active  management of the level of reserves.  We \u2019re committed to robustly implementing that framework , as you can see by our actions.  And the purpose of all this, let \u2019s remember, is to assure that our monetary policy decisions will be transmitted to the federal funds rate, which in turn affects other short -term rates.  We have the tools to accomplish that , and we will use them.  The purpose of all this is not to eliminate all volatility , particularly in the repo market. So, taking you back, this \u2014as you know , we h ad very gradually allowed the balance sheet to shrink, we slowed that gradual pace by half in March, and then we ended it in July. Meanwhile, we had surveyed all of the banks, and particularly the large banks who hold a lot of the reserves,  and said , \u201cWha t\u2019s your lowest comfortable level of reserves? \u201d  We got those numbers, we added them up, we added a buffer , and it came out sort of at a level that was well below where we were in September.  And yet we saw , actually , in September that reserves \u2014the markets acted as though reserves had become scarce. So what had happened was that liquidity , which actually existed , didn \u2019t flow into the repo market , and that had effects on the federal funds rate.  So the question is, why did that happen?\n\nDecember 11, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nAnd we \u2019ve been very carefully looking at the reasons why that might have happened.  T here are\u2014there are  payments issues, there have been a number of supervisory and regulatory issues raised \u2014we \u2019re looking carefully at those.  We \u2019re open to ideas for modifying supervisory and regulatory practice in ways that don \u2019t undermine safety and soundness , and a number of ideas are under \u2014under  examination there.  To go through it sort of by\u2014in time, we started off , really , on September  17 with overnight operations .  By October 11 we had cr eated and put into effect a plan.  T hat plan is in effect.  It \u2019s working.  I think , for the last couple of months, repo markets have been functioning well, short -term rates are stable, markets are functioning. So you asked about year -end.  T emporary upward pressures  on short -term money market rates are not unusual around year -end.  And our \u2014both our repo operations and Treasury bill purchases are intended to mitigate the risks that such pressures pose to our control of the federal funds rate.  We think that the pressures appear manageable, and we stand ready to adjust the details of our operations as necessary to keep the federal funds rate in the target range.  Our strategy has been \u2014essentially , the key to our strategy is to supply reserves in the near term through\u2014through both overnight and term repo, a nd, at the same time, we \u2019re raising the underlying level of reserves through bill purchases.  I \u2019ll take that now. We\u2019ve said bills \u2014bill purchases.  We\u2019ve also said that we were willing to ad apt our strategy.  We \u2019re not at this place , but if it does become appropriate for us to purchase other short - term coupon securities, then we would be prepared to do that if \u2014if the need arises.  So \u2014but we don\u2019t\u2014we don\u2019t \u2014we \u2019re not in that place .  It looks \u2014it very much looks li ke the bill \u2014so those bill purchases are going well , just according to expectations.  I mean, the other thing I \u2019ll say is that we \u2019re in, you know, very regular contact with market participants all the time.  We \u2019ll be\n\nDecember 11, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nproviding\u2014 we\u2019ll be continuing that , and we \u2019re prepared to adjust our tactics.  We\u2019 re\u2014we\u2019re focused on\u2014on year -end as well and prepared to adjust our operations as appropriate. MICHAEL MCKEE.  The follow -up to t hat would be , where are we with the possibility of a standing repo facility? CHAIR POW ELL.  So, on the standing repo facility, as you know , we\u2019ve actually had a couple of meetings where we\u2019 ve discussed that.  I think the standing repo facility is something that\u2019ll take some time to evaluate and create the parameters of and put into place.  At the moment what we \u2019re focused on is, you know \u2014we \u2019re now focused on year -end.  I should also mention that after the  year -end, the sense of it is that as the underlying level of reserves moves up because of bill purchases , as that happens , there will come a time when it will be appropriate for overnight and term repo to gradually decline.  We don\u2019 t know \u2014we can \u2019t know today what the timing of that will be , but that \u2019s the way \u2014that\u2019s the way  we see it going over time. HEATHER L ONG.  Heather Lo ng from the Washington Post.  A number of your colleagues have said explicitly that they do not think the FOMC should raise interest rates until core inflation is back at 2 percent.  They think there should be a rule.  Where do you personally stand on that ? CHAIR POWELL.  Well, as I mentioned , actually , at the last press conference, we think our policy rate is appropriate and will remain appropriate as long as incoming data are broadly in keeping with our \u2014with our  outlook.  And in order to move rates up, I would want to see inflation that\u2019 s persistent and that \u2019s significant \u2014a significant move -up in inflation that \u2019s also persistent before raising rates to address inflation concerns.  That \u2019s my view. HEATHER LONG.  S o is this de facto policy of the C ommittee then?  I guess I \u2019m wondering why it \u2019s not sort of codified in a statement.\n\nDecember 11, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nCHAIR POWELL.  We haven \u2019t\u2014we haven\u2019t  tried to turn it into some sort of, you know, official forward guidance.  It happens to be my view that that \u2019s what it would take to want to move interest rates up in order to deal with inflation. JEANNA SMIALEK.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Jeanna Smialek with the New York Times.   Just following up on Heather \u2019s question \u2014so if you look at the SEP today, it looks l ike inflation is never overshooting 2 percent and is only getting up to 2 percent by the end of 2021, yet rates are increasing in 2021.  So, I guess , how do we square that circle , with interest rates increasing before inflation ever really moves up in some meaningful overshooting way? CHAIR POWELL.  I think what you\u2019 re seeing is, you\u2019 ve got a full year of the median being flat , which is , we think, accommodative, modestly accommodat ive, and inflation not moving up very much, as we\u2019 ve discussed.  And that underscores , I think , the challenge of getting inflation to move up.  The C ommittee has wanted inflation to be at 2 percent, squarely at 2 percent , for\u2014ever since I arrived in 2012.  And it hasn \u2019t happened, and it \u2019s just \u2014it\u2019s because there are disinflationary forces around the world , and they\u2019 ve been stronger than, I think , people understood them to be. In terms of those out -year rate increases, what \u2019s you\u2019 re\u2014you \u2019re looking at rate in creases more than a year into the future , and, you know, people will have their own explanations for why they do that, but we \u2014really, none of us have much of a sense of what the economy will be like in 2021.  So I think what may be behind some of that is just the thought that , over time , it would be appropriate \u2014if you believe that the neutral rate is 2\u00bd percent , it would be appropriate for your rates to move up in that direction.  I will also say to you that a number of people wrote down, and you can\u2019 t see this at this level of detail,  but\u2014today \u2014but a number of people did write down overshoots of inflation as appropriate \u2014under appropriate policy.\n\nDecember 11, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nBRENDAN GREELEY.  Brendan Greeley from the Financial Times.  Given that inflation \u2014whichever measure you choose \u2014ha s either sort of remain ed where it is or not increased over the past year as you \u2019ve been dropping the policy rate , what is it that gives you confidence that the Fed has the tools to get inflation back up to target or even overshoot as you just indicated th at some people are considering doing? CHAIR POWELL.  Well, it \u2019s just that there is still, empirically , by many, many different \u2014by the work of many different analysts , there is a relationship between resource utilization , by which I mean unemployment , and i nflation .  It\u2019s just relatively weak.  And, by the way, that \u2019s not a bad thing.  T hat means that we can run at low levels of unemployment and have a historically good\u2014in some dimensions \u2014labor market without having to worry about inflation. It also means, though, that it\u2019 s not easy to move inflation up. Now, you say, why is there confidence?  I mean, I would say there \u2019s more humility than there is confidence in this at this point.  It \u2019s been very challenging to get inflation to be at target. If you look ar ound the world, the United States, of all major economies, has been closest to it but still hasn \u2019t quite been able to achieve it.  And I would also point out that this year , which has been a good year for the economy, inflation \u2014core inflation is actually running at 1.6 percent, whereas it ran close to 2 percent most of last year.  So it\u2019s \u2014it\u2019s a real challenge, and\u2014 but I think we \u2019re using our tools as best we can to meet that challenge. NICK TIMIRAOS.  Nick Timiraos , the Wall Street Journal.   So, Chair Powell, I want to ask about the framework review , which obviously entails some kind of debate around allowing an overshoot of the 2 percent target.  And in that \u2014in that context , is merely saying that you want inflation to rise above 2 percent a  sufficient strategy for getting inflation to stay at the target, or would it compel some kind of policy action beyond deferring future rate increases to achieve that\n\nDecember 11, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\noutcome if that \u2019s the direction in which the C ommittee goes ?  In other words , it\u2019s one thing to accept inflation rising on its own opportunistically.  B ut if inflation does not materialize , would a change in the framework necessarily make it easier to generate higher inflation? CHAIR POWELL.  Well, I \u2014you know, I think the answer to the questio n of whether saying it is enough to create credibility, the answer  to that is \u201c no.\u201d  And I think you have to back that up with policy that supports the outcome , and that \u2019s what we \u2019re trying to do.  And so the \u2014 the changes that we \u2019re looking at to the framew ork are \u2014I think they take all of that on board, and\u2014but they\u2019 re\u2014what they\u2019 re\u2014what they are  designed to do is to strengthen the credibility of that\u2014of that  inflation target, but only if followed by policy.  Ultimately, it will take time to establish \u2014to move  inflation expectations up from where they are , which appears to be a bit below 2 percent , will not happen overnight .  It\u2019ll have to happen over time as credibility is built. You know, the Fed has great inflation credibility , but inflation expectations ar e anchored at about their 25- year average, which is a few ticks below 2 percent. EDWARD LAWRENCE.  We talked a lot about inflation \u2014Edward Lawrence from Fox Business Network.  We talked a lot about inflation.  I want to ask you about uncertainty.  With the House announcing that they will ratify USMCA and Canada and Mexico signing off on it, do you see that uncertainty easing now so the business investment could pick up, or are the trade tensions with China just that big elephant in the room where you might not see those business investments pick up? CHAIR POWELL.  Well, I did see the news today that it appears there \u2019s an agreement to move forward to vot e on USMCA, and, of course , it\u2019s not our role to comment on particular trade policies or criticize them one way or the other or evaluate them.  I will say , though, that getting\u2014if the deal were to be enacted , then it would certainly remove some of the trade policy\n\nDecember 11, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nuncertainty, and that would be , I believe , a positive for the economy.  And I \u2019ll say the same thing about the negotiations with China, which haven \u2019t reached that point yet. We\u2019ve been hearing from our people that we talked to\u2014the many, many people and businesses that we talked to in\u2014through the Reserve Banks that wind up being written up in the Beige Book, and they\u2019 ve been telling us all year \u2014for a year and a half , really , that trade policy uncertainty is weighing on the outlook.  And I do think that, again, without commenting on it \u2014 in any way on the process or the content of the agreement, I think tha t uncertainty \u2014removal of uncertainty around that would be a positive for the economy as well. EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Is one uncertainty bigger than the other ?  Is\u2014do you see \u2014not commenting on the deals themselves , is one uncertainty\u2014 CHAIR POWELL.  Well , I thin k you can\u2014you know, it \u2019s\u2014I think you can see that what \u2019s been moving\u2014one way to look at it is , what \u2019s been moving financial markets ?  It\u2019s been news about the negotiations with China, not so much USMC A.  I think the difference between NAFTA and USMCA is \u2014is smaller than the difference between current, you know, arrangements with China and what \u2019s being negotiated. MATTHEW BOESLER.  Hi, Matthew Boesler at Bloomberg.  Chair Powell, the Fed policy review this year has largely been discussed in terms of the infla tion side of the mandate and the need to shore up inflation expectations.  But it seems like the message you \u2019ve been getting from the Fed Listens  events and also something else you\u2019 ve recently acknowledged is that, you know, the Fed has also been systematically overestimating labor utilization throughout this expansion.  So I \u2019m wondering if you could talk a little bit about the extent to which the review is looking at the employment side of the mandate as well.  Are there any possibilities, you\n\nDecember 11, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nknow, for perhaps systematizing a more asymmetric reaction function with regard to unemployment?  Thank you. CHAIR POWELL.  Yes.  So the \u2014you know, the focus really is on how to use our strategi es, tools , and communications to achieve both sides of the mandate.  And you\u2019 re right, though, that we \u2019ve talked here a lot about inflation.  And I think that the \u2014I think , more broadly, over a period of years \u2014many years \u2014we \u2019ve been learning that the natural  rate of unemployment is lower .  It\u2019s just been \u2014it\u2019 s in estimates not just at the Fed , but among \u2014broadly among economists \u2014labor economists have seen that the connection \u2014that we can sustain much lower levels of unemployment than had been thought .  And, as I  mentioned, that\u2019s a good thing because that means we\u2014we  don\u2019 t have to worry so much about inflation.  And that \u2019s\u2014and you see the benefits of that in today \u2019s labor market. I\u2014you know, the Fed Listens events are about inflation to a much lesser extent than they are about maximum employment.  If you\u2019ve \u2014if you\u2019ve  listen ed to or attended any of those, the discussion \u2014we always focus on inflation as well , but the discussion is really around what \u2019s happening in low - and moderate -income communities and among small businesses.  And I think you\u2014you get a perspective , which \u2014you know, we were already getting that from our extensive outreach to community groups and such.  But it was help to get \u2014helpful to get it in  the context of a monetary policy review.  And I think that the fact that these communities have so much\u2014 such high levels of unemployment and low levels of labor force participation tells you that there is slack out there.  And I think that does also infor m our understanding of what we mean by \u201cmaximum employment .\u201d And it\u2019s been a very positive \u2014I would say that the Fed Listens  events have been \u2014have been  extraordinarily positive , and they\u2019 re certainly something w e\u2019ll repeat.  You also see from\n\nDecember 11, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nthe business p erspective that companies are taking all kinds of measures to \u2014you know, to look through things on people \u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9s that would have perhaps disqualified them in other kinds of environments, training is moving up\u2014you hear just a lot \u2014there are a lot of things  going on that suggest that people at the margins of the labor force are being pulled in and being given chances, which is a great thing. MATTHEW BOESLER.  T hanks.  Sorry, if I could just follow up briefly \u2014is there any way to sort of systematize these insights , do you think, with, you know, in terms of \u2014we talk a lot about , for example , makeup strategies on the inflation side .  Is there anything similar you could do on the employment side? CHAIR POWELL.  You know, I \u2014I think we have kind of internalized \u2014and this isn\u2019 t\u2014 this isn\u2019t news for today, this is something we \u2019ve been saying for, you know, for several years \u2014 you\u2019ve seen us moving down our estimates of the \u2014of maximum employment.  In fact , it\u2019s already \u2014it\u2019s already understood, I think, that \u2014that  there \u2019s more \u2014even though we \u2019re at 3\u00bd percent unemployment , there \u2019s actually more slack out there, in a sense.  A nd\u2014and the risks of, you know, using accommodative monetary policy, our tool , to explore that are relatively low. And I think we know that , and I think the review certainly underscores that , but that\u2019s \u2014that \u2019s a very important insight. VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi, Victoria Guida with Politico.  I wanted to ask more about the \u2014 the repo issues and what you all are doing beyond open market operations.  Ar e you currently, for example , telling examiners not to prefer reserves over Treasuries for supervisory purposes? Are you talking to the Treasury Department about maybe reducing the level of volatility in their account at the Fed?  And on the standing repo facility , is it, you know, that you would be\n\nDecember 11, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\ninclined to do it , but you need to figure out the details ?  Or\u2014or what would kind of drive the decision on whether or not to do that? CHAIR POWELL.  So, on Treasuries versus reserves, we \u2019ve done a ton of work on that. We\u2019ve talked to supervisors , and\u2014it \u2019s interesting, if you look at the banks, they\u2019 re all over the place on the composition of their \u2014of their  buffer.  So you have to have \u2014you have a business model , and that business model suggests what your stress outflows will be , and that suggests what your buffer should be.  And you see them making quite different choices.  Some of them have lots of reserves and, you know, fewer T reasuries, and then they change their mind and they switch, so i t\u2019s not obvious that  there \u2019s one thing happening there.  Notwithstanding that, we have \u2014we\u2019ve gone out to try to understand that , talking to supervisors. In terms of the \u2014the  TGA, you know, we have not tried to pull the TGA into this yet ; we\u2019ve taken it as exogenous.  I don\u2019 t know that at some point we won\u2019 t have those discussions , but, you know, Treasury \u2014we want Treasury to be able to have the cash that it needs.  And then we should\u2014we are essentially taking that as exogenous to our \u2014to our  work .  And, you know, there may come a time when we \u2014when we  talk about that, but we haven\u2019 t done much of that. Standing repo facility\u2014so your question on that is, what are we thinking about it?  What are we\u2014I mean, I \u2014so I think we\u2019re \u2014we are more focused , frankly, on the T \u2014the bill purchases, t he year -end, and also the review of supervisory and regulatory issues that we \u2019re digging into, and\u2014because we think, you know, there \u2019s\u2014these are structural things \u2014right? \u2014 where you could, without sacrificing safety and soundness, just allow the \u2014allow the  liquidity that is already there to flow more freely , perhaps by making fairly straightforward, noncontroversial changes .  And we think there is some of that , though\u2014a nd so we \u2019re working hard and fast.  But those are things, you know, the \u2014if they take rule changes, it \u2019ll take, you\n\nDecember 11, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nknow, a notice of public rulemaking\u2014i t\u2019ll take three  months and things like that.  Those things take time.   These things that we\u2019 re working on now , though\u2014like, you know, going through year-end with the overnight facilities and the  bill purchases and the term repo\u2014those are \u2014those are things we have to do right now and are doing. CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.  Hi, Chris Rugaber  at Associated Press.   I wanted to ask, the only change in the statement was a drop in the reference to uncertainties around the economy.  You seem very confident that \u2014or it implies there \u2019s a lot of confidence that those uncertainties have gone away.  What caused you to make that change for the  statement?  What were you looking at that  seemed to be so much lower ? CHAIR POWELL.   Well, we did , actually \u2014if you look at the statement, you\u2019 ll notice that we \u2014we  did call out global developments and muted inflation pressures later in the statement.  And why did  we do that?  You know, those are the things that we \u2019ve been monitoring all year.   We \u2019ve put now in place policies that we think are appropriate to address those things , so we \u2019re not revisiting that.   But those are \u2014those are  just key things , and they haven\u2019 t gone away , so we thought it was appropriate to mention them there \u2014still subject to the idea that, for us to change our stance, we would want to see a material reassessment of the outlook. CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.  Well, just to follow real qu ick, on the material\u2014material reassessment aspect, are you worried that that has set too high a bar for potential cuts next year? We were talking about rate hikes, but no\u2014no Fed policymaker seems to foresee any cuts next year.  Some economist s do.  Does a  material reassessment mean you need to see data actually worsen?  Does it reduce your ability to act preemptively the way , arguably, you did this year? CHAIR POWELL.  So,  I mean,  one thing that we \u2019re mindful of is that we \u2019ve cut rates three times since Ju ly.  That \u2019s 75 basis points \u2019 worth of cuts.  And we do believe that monetary\n\nDecember 11, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\npolicy operates with long and variable lags , and that it will take some time before the full effects of those actions are seen in the economy.  So that \u2019ll take some time.   So that \u2019s one reason to hold back and\u2014and  wait.  And we thought \u2014I think we took strong measures.  In fact, if you look at\u2014more broadly at the Treasury yield curve, it has moved more than 75 basis points.  So you\u2019ve\u2014you\u2019ve  had quite a significant move in the direction of higher accommodation. In terms of what \u2019s\u2014you know, what is material at the end of the day, w ell, I would just say, whether or not a change in the outlook merits a policy response will be a collective judgme nt of the FOMC.  There isn \u2019t any single factor that will determine our decisions.  We\u2019ll\u2014 we\u2019ll look at a full range of data and other information bearing on the economic outlook. SCOTT HORSLEY.  Thank you Mr. Chairman, Scott Horsley for NPR.  You started out by talking about Paul Volcker , who obviously cast a \u2014a long shadow.  I wonder if , in hindsight , that shadow was\u2014was  too long, and if \u2014in the decades since his tenure and , in particular, last year, if the Fed was too quick to raise interest rates to attack  an inflation bogeyman that didn \u2019t materialize. CHAIR POWELL.   So I \u2014this wouldn\u2019 t be a \u2014my response will not be about Paul Volcker , but\u2014so, well, you started with Paul Volcker.  So, if you look back at 2018 \u2014I\u2019ll just take you back to the beginning of 2018.  We had an economy growing at 3 percent , we had inflation at 2 percent, and we had a trillion and a half dollars \u2019 worth of stimulus arriving, a nd the federal funds rate was 1.4 percent.  So it wasn \u2019t that \u2014so we moved\u2014we moved policy up during the course of  the year.  We never got policy even at the level of what we thought the neutral rate was at th e time.  So there was no sense of it being restrictive.  We took steps to make it less accommodative, and that seemed to be the right thing.  It still seems to m e to be the right thing in hindsight.  The idea that we were trying to, you know, slow the economy down\u2014w e\n\nDecember 11, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nwere really just trying to get near neutral.  A nd even with the last rate increase a year ago, we were still meaningfully below the median estimate o n the Com mittee of what the neutral rate was.  So policy was always accommodative during the course of that year. I think what \u2019s happened is , the\u2014obviously, the facts on the ground have change d.  You saw the global economic slowdown begin in the middle of last year, gather force, and then continue to go on this year, so you\u2019 ve seen a continual weakening.  Just look at the IM F\u2019s forecast s of growth from, you know, the spring of 2018 and compare them to now.  You\u2019ve had quite a significant \u2014that does affect us.  I think , also, the trade situation was just beginning in the middle of \u2019 18, and I think it had \u2014has had\u2014you know, I think the re\u2019ll be a very, very wide range of estimates of the effect , but I think it \u2019s had a meaningful effect on output just through the uncertainty channel and,  to a lesser extent , through\u2014through, you know, the tariff effects.  And , again, that \u2019s not to make a judgment.  It\u2019 s not up to us to make a judgment about that.  So, that \u2019s what \u2014that would be my  story. DONNA BORAK.   Chair Powell, D onna Borak with CNN.  To follow  up on Edward\u2019 s trade question , could you talk about what you would imagine the economic effect would be if negotiations with China were to fall apart and how the Fed might be able to support the economy in that event? CHAIR POWELL.  You know, I wouldn\u2019 t want to speculate on \u2014on a hypothetical .  I would say\u2014we\u2019ll just have to see.  W e\u2019re\u2014we look at a range of factors and we \u2019ve\u2014as I \u2019ve said before, we try to look through the volatility in trade news  and trade negotiations.  We t ry not to react.  We can \u2019t react.  Monetary policy is not the right tool to react in the very short  term to volatility and, you know, things that can change back and forth and back and forth a s this has\n\nDecember 11, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nhappened, as is probably typical of a \u2014of a  large complex negotiation.  So, in terms of \u2014you know, I \u2014again, I don\u2019 t want to get into hypothetical outcomes , though, if that \u2019s all right. DONNA BORAK.  I\u2019m just wondering, you met with the President last month.  Did you have any advice for him when it c ame to this, and did you express some concerns about the potential volatility and the impact of the economy on\u2014given all this? CHAIR POWELL.  You know, I \u2014I\u2019m going to stick with my and my predecessors \u2019 longtime practice of not discussing private meetings w ith elected officials\u2014or other officials , really .  But thank you. VIRGINIE MONTET.  Thank you.  Virginie Montet with Agence France -Presse. Yesterday, Democratic leaders in the House have launched an impeachment process against the President.  Have you mentioned these developments within the Committee, as \u2014today as potentially presenting some risks for their confidence in the economy? CHAIR POWELL.  No.  We have not.  We don\u2019 t consider things like that. MICHAEL DERBY.  Mike Derby with Dow Jones News wires.  Does the Fed \u2019s dot plot still serve a useful communications purpose , or do you feel that it might be time to retire  it or change it in some fashion? CHAIR POWELL.  With \u2014I think properly understood, it can be useful , but that \u2019s been a challenge.  You know, I think \u201c properly understood\u201d  to me means looking at what it is and not at what it isn \u2019t.  And what it is  is, it\u2019s an expression of the thinking about individual Committee members about appropriate monetary policy and the path of the economy.  Remember tha t we write all that down , and we send it in , and it gets compiled.  But we don\u2019 t discuss it at the meeting , and we don\u2019 t negotiate a plan.  There is no\u2014t here\u2019s no agreement.  There \u2019s no plan.\n\nDecember 11, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nAnd I think, particularly at inflection points, it\u2019 s hard to convey the reality , which is that policy is always going to depend on the economic outlook and changes in the economic outlook. And when the economic outlook is changing, the dots are \u2014they\u2019re just not a consideration. We\u2019re going to do what we think is the right thing for the economy.  And if the fact \u2014dots that we did six  months ago or three  months ago don\u2019 t agree with that, that \u2019s not even in the conversation.  So its more \u2014but it can it be useful if \u2014and I think\u2014but , as I said, it \u2019s been a challenge , and so I \u2014I do\u2014I do like to say , if you focus too much on the dots, you can\u2014you can miss the broader picture. GREG ROBB.  Greg Robb from MarketWatch.  Chairman Powell, many people seem worried that the framework that you guys are working on is going to be \u2014the results are going to be less rather than more.  And I \u2014people keep coming back and saying why\u2014asking why you took off , like , a 4 percent inflation rate off the table even when it started.  I mean, as you said , going around the country for all the Listen  events, I don\u2019 t think I heard anybody worry about a 4 percent inflation rate or think that a higher inflation rate was going to be a problem.  So where does that concern come from?  Is it members of Congress that have\u2014have  said this? CHAIR POWELL.  No.  S o let me say , we\u2019re\u2014we\u2019ve been working on this all year. And we \u2019re just at the stage where we\u2019 ve had a really interesting discussion about the various tools that we have at the October meeting.  At this meeting, we talked about the way monetary policy affects different groups in the economy.  So we had a \u2014we talked about the Fed Listens events and some very interesting research.  So we \u2019re just getting to the stage where we \u2019re looking at conclusions .  You know , what do we take away from all this?  And those things \u2014 many of those things would wind up as changes , if you will, modifications to the \u201cStatement of Longer -Run G oals and Monetary P olicy S trategy. \u201d  I think that process will take until the midd le\n\nDecember 11, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nof the year where \u2014but we want to approach it very thoroughly and very carefully.  And that is \u2014 in effect, that is our framework document.  And I wouldn\u2019 t prejudge.  No one \u2014I believe we will be able to \u2014to reach a successful conclusion and make meaningful improvements.  I do. In terms of \u201c 4 percent \u201d\u2014so that \u2019s\u2014I think it \u2019s premature for people to be saying that this isn\u2019t going anywhere.  You know \u2014and if you define going anywhere as a 4 percent inflation target\u2014let me talk about the 4 percent inflation targe t.  So I \u2019ll go back to the point that just saying words is not itself credible.   So I think if you said, \u201cW e\u2019re raising the inflation target to 4,\u201d what would be the effect of that?  I mean, where\u2019 s the credibility in that, really?  You haven\u2019 t been able to get it to 2.  So I think we \u2014I think you need to lower your sights a little bit.  I also think, is 4 percent \u2014you \u2019d have to ask the question, is that really, you know, price stability?  Is that really price stability?  Is that within our legal mandate?  I mean , I think it\u2019 s a fair question. So, you know, I think\u2014 I\u2019d like for this review to come out with very\u2014 a set of positive results\u2014you know, meaningful improvements.  It doesn\u2019 t mean it has to solve every problem going forward.  We want to \u2014we want to  have this be a successful exercise where we meaningfully improve our monetary policy framework.  These things don \u2019t tend to move in \u2014 you know, in a lurchy way, t hey tend to evolve.  But I think \u2014and if we do this , then in a few years, again and again  and things like that , then we can \u2014at least we\u2019 re moving in a good direction.  And I think we will be.  I\u2019m confident we will be. DON LEE.  Don Lee with the L.A. Times.   Chair Powell, you\u2019 ve had a busy year , and I \u2019m wondering, as you look back, what things you might have done differently.  A nd are there any lessons that you would take into next year? CHAIR POWELL.  Well, you know , I have to say, my total focus is on right now and getting policy right and thinking about next year \u2014you know, thinki ng about what \u2019s the economy\n\nDecember 11, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\ngoing to be doing.  I like where we are on policy,  as I mentioned.  I think our policy stance is appropriate and likely to remain so as long as the outlook is broadly like this.  You know \u2014I mean, it \u2019s too long of a question.  Yo u know, I don\u2019 t know how to get after that.  There \u2019s\u2014 there\u2019s  a lot of learning that comes into\u2014from the economy every year and in the way we do our jobs.  And, you know, we \u2019re always going to be trying to learn lessons. DON LEE.   I mean, are there any part icular surprises, whether it \u2019s the economy or how markets or financial \u2014 CHAIR POWELL.  Well, I\u2014s o, ye s.  I didn\u2019 t\u2014obviously, you know, didn\u2019 t see and I don\u2019t think anybody saw coming the \u2014the  challenges that we faced this year.  I think they were a surprise.   I think that , toward the end of 2018, there was still a sense the economy was growing at around 3 percent.  And I didn\u2019 t expect the \u2014to face the challenges, but I think we did face them , and I think we \u2014I\u2019m pleased that we moved to support the economy in the way that we did.  I think our moves will prove appropriate.  And , again, I think both the economy and monetary policy right now , I think , are in a good place. NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.   I\u2019m Nancy Marshall -Genzer from Marketplace. Chair Powell, wh y aren \u2019t we seeing stronger wage gains?   Wages are growing more slowly now than they were toward the beginning of the year.  Why is that? CHAIR POWELL.  Well, wage gains have moved up a bit.  If you look back three , four years, you\u2019 ll see wages are growing around 2 percent.  Now you see them moving up, you know, more at 3, 3\u00bd  percent.  So why aren \u2019t they growing higher, at a faster rate?  And it \u2019s a couple of things.  I think there are a range of explanations.  For instance, one would be that productivity has just been low.  So wages should go up to cover inflation and productivity.  Productivity has been low , and that \u2014that is very likely to be holding back wages.  I also think there are other\n\nDecember 11, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\npossible potential explanations , such as, you know, globalization can be \u2014the idea that you can make, manufacture, or even provide services anywhere in the world to anywhere in the world.  I think that hangs over the wage -setting process\u2014 and everywhere , pretty much.  You don\u2019 t see\u2014 there i sn\u2019t the kind of traction in the wage market that\u2014even in a tight labor market. Another thing is , though,  that the labor market may not be as tight as we had thought it was.  And, you know, I think there \u2014there are many, many possible explanations.  I will say , though, if you look, for example , at nonsupervisory employees in the labor report, there are \u2014 their wages are going up at 3.7 percent.  And so, you do see \u2014and wages are going up the most for people at the lower  end of the \u2014that \u2019s been true for the last couple of years \u2014lower  end of the wage spectrum.   So you do see wages moving up.  It\u2019s  just\u2014they\u2019re not moving up at \u2014at very high rates.  And, again , at the end of the day, that probably has most to do with productivity. NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  Can I ask  a quick follow -up?  Just as far as the market not being as tight as you thought, are you saying there are still more people on the sidelines who could join the labor force? CHAIR POWELL.  Well, y es.  And I would also say that we \u2014if you ask people, and we did ask people, what do you think the natural rate of unemployment is?  People were writing down numbers in the fives , and then they were writing down numbers in the fours.  And now, unemployment has been in the threes for a year and a half , and we still s ee wage inflation , as you mentioned.  The level of wage inflation has actually moved down, a lthough, there may be compositional effects in that number that may\u2014that may  be, to some extent , about younger workers coming in at lower wages that \u2014than retiring w orkers . But you wouldn\u2019 t\u2014that shouldn\u2019 t have much of an effect , actually.  So why is that ?  It may just be that there \u2019s more slack in the economy.  And I think we are seeing that.  We\u2019re\n\nDecember 11, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nseeing \u2014really , it showed up through higher participation.  For many years, we\u2019ve  thought that there \u2019s a trend decline in participation.  Notwithstanding that, against that trend , we\u2019ve seen prime -age participation moving up pretty steadily over the last two  or three  years.  And it\u2019s a very positive thing, but it does sort of provide more labor supply, meaning a less tight labor market. HANNAH LANG.   Hi.  Hannah Lang with American Banker.   Thanks for being here today.  I just wanted to ask about the Community Reinvestment Act , since the FDIC and OCC may pot entially join together with a \u2014for a proposal without the Fed.  Are you concerned that this might cause confusion, and how would the mechanics work if this proposal is finalized without the Fed? CHAIR POWELL.  So, you know, we think the CRA \u2014we know the CRA is a very important law , and we \u2019re strongly committed to the mission of e nsuring that banks provide credit to their\u2014throughout their communities , particularly addressing the needs of low - and moderate - income households and neighborhoods.  We also think it \u2019s time for modernization.  We \u2019ve thought that for some  time, and we worked very hard to try to get aligned with the OCC , really , on\u2014on a proposal.  And my hope is that we can still do that .  You know , I don\u2019 t know whether that\u2019ll be possible or not.  It will have to \u2014well, we\u2019ll just have to see , but\u2014and if we \u2014if we can\u2019t, I don\u2019 t\u2014I\u2019m not sure what the path forward would be.  We would certainly not want to create confusion or, you know, sort of tension between the regimes if they do turn out to be slightly different regimes.   So that \u2019s something we \u2014I hope we don\u2019 t have to face , but we will if we have to. BRIAN CHEUNG.  Hi there.  Brian Cheung with Yahoo Finance.  So , before the July meeting, you said something kind of colorful.  You said, \u201c To call something \u2018hot,\u2019 you would\n\nDecember 11, 2019   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nneed to see some heat, \u201d referring to the labor market.  So to expand a bit, I guess , on Nancy\u2019 s question, it seems like the wage Phillips curve has been pretty well explored already , but what would you need to see to call the labor market \u201c hot\u201d in that case?  Would it be a contract \u2014or, rather, some sort of change in either the headline number of gains or in t he unemployment rate? CHAIR POWELL.  Really, wages.  I mean, we \u2014there\u2019s so many other measures that suggest that the labor market is \u2014I like to say  the labor market is strong.  I don\u2019 t really want to say that it \u2019s tight.  Someone asked me a question about a  hot labor market \u2014that was in the Humphrey- Hawkins hearings.  S o I\u2019ll say that the labor market is strong.   I don\u2019 t know that it \u2019s tight, because you \u2019re not seeing wage increases, you know.  Ultimately , if it\u2019s tight, those should be\u2014should be  reflected in  higher wage increases, so it does come down to that.  You know, we look at countless measures of labor market \u2014you know, labor utilization, and there \u2019s so many \u2014 it\u2019s too many to count.  But the one that has \u2014that is kind of suggesting that you\u2019 re\u2014it\u2019s a healthy number that, you know, the  sort of 3.1 percent average hourly earnings number is a decent number \u20143.7 percent for production and nonsupervisory workers is more healthy. Ultimately , though, we \u2019d like to see \u2014to call it \u201c hot,\u201d  you\u2019 d want to see heat.  You \u2019d want to see, you know, higher wages.  Thanks."

My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. The economy has made good progress toward our dual -mandate objectives.  Inflation has eased from its highs without a significant increase in unemployment.  That\u2019 s very good news.  But inflation is still too high, ongoing progress in bringing it down is not assured, and the path forward is uncertain.  I want to assure the American people that we\u2019 re fully committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent goal.  Restoring price stability is essential to achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditi ons that benefit all. Today, the FOMC decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings.  Over the past two years, we \u2019ve significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy.  Our strong actions have moved our policy rate well into restrictive territory, and we \u2019ve been seeing the effects on economic activity and inflation.  As labor market tightness has eased and progress on inflation has continued, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals are moving into better balance.  I will have more to say about monetary policy \u2014 about monetary policy, after briefly reviewing economic developments. Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace. GDP growth in the fourth quarter of last year came in at 3.3 percent.  For 2023 as a whole, GDP expanded at 3.1 percent, bolstered by strong consumer demand as well as im proving supply conditions.  Activity in the housing sector was subdued over the past year, largely reflecting high mortgage rates.  High interest rates also appear to have been weighing on business fixed investment.\n\nJanuary 31, 2024   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nThe labor market remains tight, but supply and demand conditions continue to come into better balance.  Over the past three months, payroll job gains averaged 165,000 jobs per month, a pace that is well below that seen a year ago but still strong.  The unemployment rate remains low at 3.7 percent.  Strong job creation has been accompanied by an increase in the supply of workers .  The labor force participation rate has moved up , on balance , over the past year, particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years , and immigration has returned to pre -pandemic levels.  Nominal wage growth has been easing, and job vacancies have declined.  Although the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply of available workers. Inflation has eased notably over the past year but remains above our longer -run goal of 2 percent.  Total PCE prices rose 2.6  percent over the 12 months ending in December; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.9 percent .  The lower inflation readings over the second half of last year are welcome .  But we will need to see continuing evidence to build confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our goal.  Longer - term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets. The Fed \u2019s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.  My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship , as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.  We\u2019re highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we\u2019re strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective. Over the past two years, we have raised our policy rate by 5\u00bc  percentage points, and we\u2019ve decreased our securities holdings by more than $1.3 trillion.  Our restrictive stance of\n\nJanuary 31, 2024   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nmonetary policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation.  The Committee decided at today \u2019s meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5\u00bc to 5\u00bd percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings. We believe that our policy rate is likely at its peak for this tightening cycle and that, if the economy evolves broadly as expected, it will likely be appropriate to begin dialing back policy restraint at some point this year.  But the economy has surpris ed forecasters in many ways since the pandemic, and ongoing progress toward our 2 percent inflation objective is not assured.  The economic outlook is uncertain, and we remain highly attentive to inflation risks.  We \u2019re prepared to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for longer if appropriate. As labor market tightness has eased and progress on inflation has continued, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals are moving into better balance.  We know that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could result in a reversal o f the progress we \u2019ve seen on inflation and ultimately require even tighter policy to get inflation back to 2 percent.  At the same time, reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment.  In considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.  The Committee does not expect that it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.  We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting. We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keeping longer -run\u2014 longer -term inflation expectations well anchored.  Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer  run.\n\nJanuary 31, 2024   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nTo conclude :  We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country.  Everything we do is in service to our public mission.  We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals. Thank you.  I look forward to our questions. MICHELLE SMITH.  Jeanna . JEANNA SMIALEK.  Jeanna Smialek from the New York Times.   Thanks for taking our questions.  Obviously, in the statement and just in your remarks there, you note that you don\u2019 t want to cut interest rates without greater confidence that inflation is coming \u2014coming down fully.  I wonder \u2014what do you need to see at this point to gain that confidence?  And as you make those decisions, how are you weighing recent strong growth in consumer spending data against the sort of solid inflation progress you \u2019ve been seeing? CHAIR POWELL.  Sorry \u2014say that last part again. JEANNA SMIALEK.  How are \u2014how are  you weighing the growth data and consumption data, which have been surprisingly strong, against inflation data? CHAIR POWELL.  Okay.  So, what are we looking for to get greater confidence?   Let me say that we have confidence.  We \u2019re\u2014we\u2019re  looking for greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably down to 2 percent.  Implicitly, we do have confidence , and it has been increasing, but we want to get greater confidence .  What do we want to see?  We want to see more good data.  It \u2019s not that we \u2019re looking for better data.  It\u2019s\u2014we\u2019re looking at continuation of the good data that we \u2019ve been seeing, and a good example is inflation.  So we have six months of good inflation data.  The question really is, that six months of good inflation data \u2014is it sending us a true signal that we are, in fact, on a path\u2014a sustainable path down to 2 percent inflation?   That \u2019s the question.  And the answer will come from some more data that \u2019s also good\n\nJanuary 31, 2024   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\ndata.  It doesn\u2019t \u2014it\u2019s not that the six -month data isn\u2019 t\u2014isn\u2019t  low enough.  It is.  It\u2019s just a question of, can we take that with confidence that we \u2019re moving sustainably down to 2 percent? That\u2019s really what we\u2019 re thinking about. In terms of, of  growth, we \u2019ve had strong growth.  I mean, if you take a step back, we \u2019ve had strong growth\u2014very strong growth [in real GDP] last year \u2014going right into the fourth quarter.  And yet we \u2019ve had a very strong labor market, and we \u2019ve had inflation coming down. So I think \u2014whereas a year ago , we, we were thinking that we needed to see some softening in economic activity\u2014that hasn\u2019 t been the case.  So I think we , we look at \u2014we look at  stronger growth.  We don\u2019 t look at it as a problem.  I think, at this point, we want to see strong growth. We want to see a strong labor market.  We\u2019 re not looking for a weaker labor market.  We\u2019re looking for inflation to continue to come down, as it has been coming down for the last six months. JEANNA SMIALEK.  And I \u2019m sorry .  If I could just follow up very quickly, the \u2014when , when  you say that you want to make sure that it \u2019s a true signal, is there anything that you \u2019re seeing in the data that makes you doubt that it \u2019s a true signal at this stage? CHAIR POWELL.  No, I think it\u2019s \u2014I, I would say it, it seems \u2014it seems to be the likely case that , that we will achieve that confidence, but we have to achieve it, and we haven \u2019t yet. And so\u2014I mean, it \u2019s a good story.  We have six months of good inflation [readings] .  But you can\u2014and you know this \u2014you can look behind those numbers, and you can see that a lot of it \u2019s been coming from goods inflation, for example, and goods inflation running significantly negative.  It \u2019s a reasonable assumption that , over time , goods inflation will flatten out \u2014probably approximate zero.  That would mean the services sectors would have to contribute more. So, in other words, what we care about is the aggregate number \u2014not so much the composition.  But\n\nJanuary 31, 2024   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nwe, we just need to see more.  That \u2019s where we are, as a Committee.  We need to see more evidence that sort of confirms what we think we \u2019re seeing and that tells us that we are on \u2014gives us confidence that we \u2019re on, on a path to\u2014a sustainable path down to 2 percent inflation. MICHELLE SMITH.  Nick. NICK TIMIRAOS.  Nick Timiraos  of the Wall Street Journal.   Chair Powell, it seems to me you raised rates rapidly over the last two years for two reasons.  One was the risk of a wage\u2013 price spiral.  Two, there were risks of inflation expectations becoming unanchored.  This morning \u2019s ECI report for the fourth quarter shows private -sector payroll growth running at a sub\u20134 percent pace.  Inflation expectations are very close to where they were before the inflation emergency of the last three years.  And , given that you appear to have substantially cut off these two tail risks and that you \u2019ve judged here today current policy as well into restrictive territory, what good reason is there to keep policy rates above 5 percent?   Are you really going to learn more waiting six weeks versus three months from now that you have avoided those two risks? CHAIR POWELL.  So, as you know, almost every participant on the C ommittee does believe that it will be appropriate to reduce rates and  for, for \u2014partly for the reasons that you say. You know, we, w e feel like inflation is coming down.  Growth has been strong.  The labor market is strong.  We\u2019re \u2014what we \u2019re trying to do is identify a place where we \u2019re really confident about inflation getting back down to 2 percent so that we can then begin the process of dialing back the restrictive level.  So, overall, I thi nk\u2014I think  people do believe \u2014and , as you know, the median participant wrote down three rate cuts this year.  But I think to get to that place where we feel comfortable starting the process, we need some confirmation that inflation is, in fact, coming down sustainably to 2 percent.\n\nJanuary 31, 2024   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nNICK TIMIRAOS.  If I could ask differently :  If, if you hold rates high as inflation moderates, as it \u2014as it  has been, target rates will exceed the prescriptions of the Taylor rule or its variants .  What would be the reasoning for holding rates higher than the levels recommended by those rules in the current instance? CHAIR POWELL.  Well , I\u2014look, I think, as you know, we consult the range of Taylor rules and , and  non- Taylor kind of rules.  We consult them regularly.  They \u2019re in our , our Tealbook, and, and they \u2019re in all the materials that we look at.  But, you know, I don\u2019 t think we\u2019ve ever been at a\u2014 at a place where we were \u2014where we were setting policy by them.  And there \u2014depending on the rule, it will tell you different things.  There are many different formulations.  Another way to think about it is, implicitly, is\u2014so, in theory, of course, real rates go up if \u2014holding all else equal \u2014as inflation comes down.  But that doesn \u2019t mean we can mechanically adjust policy as real rates\u2014sorry \u2014as inflation comes down.  It doesn \u2019t mean that at all , because, for one thing, we , we don\u2019t know \u2014we, we look at more than just the fed funds rate.  We look at \u2014broadly\u2014financial conditions. But, in addition, we don\u2019 t know with great confidence where the neutral rate of interest is at any given time.  But that also doesn\u2019 t mean that we wait around  for\u2014to see, you know, the economy turn down, because that would be too late.  So we \u2019re really in a risk -management mode :  of managing the risk \u2014as I mentioned in my opening remarks \u2014managing the risk that we move too soon and move too late.  And I think to move, which is \u2014which is where almost everyone on the C ommittee is \u2014is in favor of , of moving rates down this year \u2014but the timing of that is going to be linked to our gaining confidence that inflation is on a sustainable path down to 2 percent. MICHELLE SMITH.  Howard.\n\nJanuary 31, 2024   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Hi.  Thanks, Chair Powell.  I \u2019d like you to, to  key in on the use of the word in, in the statement that inflation still \u201c remains elevated. \u201d  You\u2019ve pledged to cut rates before inflation reached 2 percent.  So that implies that there \u2019s some sort of intermediate step here on , on inflation and that a , a cut would be consequent with a change in the statement language that inflation \u201cremains elevated. \u201d  What \u2019s the step -down from there? CHAIR POWELL. Yeah, I , I don\u2019 t know that we \u2019ve worked out the particular s\u2014 statement language and that kind of thing.  I would just say, if you look at \u2014you know, look at where , where  12-month inflation is, and it\u2019s, you know, it \u2019s still well above \u2014core is 2.9 percent, for example \u201412- month \u2014which is way down from where it was.  Very, very positive development \u2014very fast decline\u2014a nd, and, you know, the , the case is likely that it will continue to come down.  So , so that \u2019s where \u2014that \u2019s where it is.  But  we\u2019re , you know, we \u2019re wanting to see, you know, more data. HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  So , if I\u2014if I could follow up on that, the statement allows that you want greater confidence on inflation falling before you cut, but it doesn\u2019 t mention the other side of the mandate \u2014a slide in employment.  Would a slide in employment also bring you to the point of , of cutting rates? CHAIR POWELL.  Yes.  So let me say that we\u2019 re not looking for that.  That \u2019s not something we \u2019re looking for.  But , yes, if you think about, you know \u2014in, in the base case, the economy is performing well \u2014the labor market remains strong.  If we saw an unexpected weakening in, in\u2014certainly in the labor market, that would certainly weigh on cutting sooner. Absolutely.  And if we saw inflation being stickier or higher or those sorts of things \u2014would argue for moving later.  In the base case, though, where , where  the economy is healthy and we have, you know, we have ongoing growth\u2014solid growth \u2014we have a strong labor market \u2014we\n\nJanuary 31, 2024   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nhave inflation coming down\u2014t hat\u2019s what people are writing their SEP  [submissions] around. And in that case, what we \u2019re saying is, based on that, we think we can and should take advantage of that and, and be careful as we approach that question of when to begin to dial back restriction . MICHELLE SMITH.  Claire. CLAIRE JONES.  Claire Jones, Financial Times.   Just to circle back to the \u201c greater confidence \u201d aspect of the statement, there\u2019 s been a lot of unanimity in recent meetings.  I \u2019m just wondering, going forward, when it comes to all needing greater confidence, is the re unanimity or, at least , consensus among FOMC members about what the threshold for that greater confidence is?  And if not, could you maybe tell us a little bit about the discussion today on, you know, what the variations between FOMC members was on what constitutes enough confidence to cut rates  and also if there was any variation on how quickly that \u201c greater confidence \u201d threshold could be reached?  Thank you. CHAIR POWELL.  So we\u2019re not \u2014we\u2019re not really at that stage. You know, we\u2019re \u2014 we\u2019re \u2014there was no proposal to cut rates.  Some people did, you know, talk about their view of the rate path.  I would point you to the [December  2023] SEP as , as, you know, as  good evidence of where people are, although it is \u2014it is  [now] one [FOMC meeting] cycle later.  So , you know, we\u2019re not \u2014we\u2019re not  at a place of , of really working out those kinds of details, because we weren \u2019t actively considering, you know, a \u2014moving, moving the federal funds rate down.  I will say, there is a\u2014there is a  wide disparity \u2014a healthy disparity \u2014of views, and you see that in public , public  statements , in the minutes , and the transcripts when they\u2019 re released every five years.  So  we do have a healthy set of differences, and I think that \u2019s actually essential for making good policy.  We\u2019 re also able to reach agreement , generally , because we listen to each other \u2014\n\nJanuary 31, 2024   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nwe, we compromise .  And even though not everybody loves what we do, they\u2019 re able to \u2014for the most part\u2014 able to join in.  To me, that \u2019s a well -functioning public institution. MICHELLE SMITH.  Rachel. RACHEL SIEGEL.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.  Thanks for taking our questions.  So , over the past few years, there have been all these real -time indicators that helped us gain a sharper understanding of where the economy was, like OpenT able data or office attendance.  You \u2019ve talked about vacancies in the past.  And I \u2019m wondering, at the start of this year, what might be on that dashboard for you that \u2019s giving you the clearest picture of the economy \u2014including on rents \u2014if you could touch on that. CHAIR POWELL.  Including? RACHEL SIEGEL.  Rent.  Rent costs. CHAIR POWELL.  Yeah.  Well , so we\u2019re not \u2014you know, it \u2019s not the pandemic, so we can actually rely on more , more  traditional forms.  People are working.  T hey\u2019re getting wages, and, and the economy has largely reopened and is broadly normalizing, as you see.  So I wouldn\u2019 t say we \u2019re looking at that , that  sort of more innovative data as much.  You know, you point to rent s.  So, of course, we follow the , the components of inflation very carefully.  W hich would be :  Goods inflation\u2014I talked about that a little bit ; you mentioned housing inflation.  So the question is, when will these lower market rents find their way into measured rents , as measured, measured in PCE inflation? And we think that \u2019s coming, and we know it \u2019s coming.  It \u2019s just a question of when and, and how big it \u2019ll be.  So \u2014but  that\u2019s in, in everyone \u2019s forecast, I would say. So that will \u2014that will help.  But at the same time, we think goods inflation will probably\u2014 it\u2019s been giving a lot of disinflation to the effort \u2014and probably that declines over time, but it may well have some , some\n\nJanuary 31, 2024   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nmore time to run.  You know, the se\u2014the  supply chains are not perfectly back to where they were.   In addition, it takes time for the , the healing process to get into prices.  So  there may be still a tailwind.  We\u2019 ll find out with, with  that.  So we look at the things that relate to our mandate very carefully , and\u2014as you would imagine. RACHEL SIEGEL.  I guess , just as a quick follow -up\u2014do you feel comfortable at this point saying the economy has reached a soft landing, or is that part of looking for more confidence? CHAIR POWELL.  No, I wouldn\u2019 t\u2014I wouldn\u2019t  say we\u2019 ve achieved that.  And I , I think we have \u2014we have  a ways to go.  Inflation is still \u2014you know, core inflation is still well above target on a 12- month basis.  Twelve months is our , our target, certainly.  I\u2019m encouraged, and we\u2019re encouraged by the progress.  But, you know, we \u2019re, we\u2019re not \u2014we\u2019re not declaring victory at all at this point.  We think we have a ways to go. MICHELLE SMITH.  Steve. STEVE LIESMAN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  You \u2019ve said that you would know the neutral rate by its works.  So I \u2019m wondering what you could tell me \u2014how do you believe the neutral rate is working or telling you right now that growth is stronger?  In other words, how much is the economy really being restrained right now by the current funds rate?  And how much restraint does it really need, additionally, if inflation is still coming down? CHAIR POWELL.  So it\u2019s \u2014I think you, you do see in the interest -sensitive parts of the economy\u2014 you do see, for example, housing.  You see the effects.  You do.  Your , your  second question, though, really, I think, is important, and that is , a lot of this has come through\u2014a lot of the disinflationary process has come through the healing of supply chains and also of the labor market.  So you\u2019 ve seen  the\u2014you know, that other set of factors is really different from other\n\nJanuary 31, 2024   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\ncycles and has brought that working with tighter , tighter  policy, which has enabled the supply side to recover \u2014I think is that, that mixture has been behind what has enabled this.  So, no\u2014we really do think that we \u2019re having an effect broadly across the economy.  I would point to the interest -sensitive parts of the economy as well as spending, generally.  But it \u2019s a\u2014it\u2019s a  joint story.  It \u2019s a complicated story. STEVE LIESMAN.  But , but how much restraint are you actually imparting to the economy, would you say, relative to the neutral rate? CHAIR POWELL.  It\u2019s \u2014so I think it\u2019s, it\u2019s \u2014of course , you know that it \u2019s not something you can identify with any precision.  But if you\u2014 a standard approach would be to take the nominal rate \u20145.3 percent, let \u2019s say \u2014and subtract sort of a , a forward measure of inflation.  If you do that \u2014and there are many, many ways to calculate th e neutral rate \u2014but that \u2019s one I like to do.  And , you know, you\u2019 re going to get to something that is materially above mainstream estimates of neutrality \u2014of the neutral rate \u2014you will.  And \u2014but at the same time, you look at the economy, and you say, \u201cT his is an economy that grew 3.1 percent last year. \u201d  And , and you say, \u201cWhat does that tell you about the neutral rate? \u201d  What \u2019s happening, though, is , the supply side has been recovering in the middle of this.  So that , that  won \u2019t go on forever.  So a lot of the growth we \u2019re seeing  is not \u2014is\u2014it isn \u2019t just a tug of war between , between interest rates and demand.  You \u2019re getting , you know, more activity because of the \u2014of labor market healing and supply chains healing.  So I think the question is, when that peters out, I think the , the, you know, the, the  restriction will show up probably more , more  sharply. MICHELLE SMITH.  Rich. RICH MILLER.  Thank you\u2014sorry.  Thanks for taking the question, Mr. Chairman. You mentioned earlier we \u2019re not seeking a weaker labor market, I think you, you said.  Can you\n\nJanuary 31, 2024   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\ntalk a little bit more about that?  Do you\u2014do you think the labor market now is back to quote, unquote, \u201c normal\u201d  and that the \u2014we can achieve the inflation target without wage gains coming back down to what they were pre -pandemic?  Even with today\u2019 s ECI levels, they were still above those pre -pandemic levels. CHAIR POWELL.  I , I think the labor market by many measures is at or nearing normal \u2014but not totally back to normal.  And you pointed to one or more of them.  So  I think, you know, job openings are not quite back to where they were.  Wages \u2014wage  increases, rather, are not quite back to where they\u2014 to where they would need to be in the longer run.  I , I would look at it this way, though.  The , the economy is broadly normalizing, and so is the labor market. And that process will probably take some time.  So wage setting is something that happens \u2014it\u2019s, it\u2019s\u2014you know, probably will take a couple of years to get all the way back.  And that \u2019s okay. That\u2019s okay.  But we do see \u2014you saw today\u2019 s ECI reading \u2014you know, the evidence is that , that wage increases are still at a healthy level \u2014very healthy level \u2014but they\u2019 re gradually moving back to levels that would be more associated \u2014given, given assumptions about productivity, are more typically associated with 2 percent inflation.  It\u2019s, it\u2019s an ongoing process \u2014a healthy one \u2014 and, and, you know, I think we \u2019re, we\u2019re  moving in the right direction. RICH MILLER.  So that process can continue without a weakening of the labor market, basically, you\u2019 re saying? CHAIR POWELL.  I think the , the labor market is \u2014it\u2014 I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d \u2014it\u2019s rebalancing.  Clearly , that the \u2014there was a fairly severe imbalance between demand for workers and supply at the beginning of the pandemic.  So we lost several million workers at the beginning of the pandemic from people dropping out of the labor force.  And then when the economy reopened\u2014you remember 2021\u2014you had a severe labor shortage , and it was just \u2014it\n\nJanuary 31, 2024   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nwas everywhere \u2014panic on the part of businesses \u2014couldn\u2019 t, couldn\u2019t  find people.  So , what \u2019s happened is \u2014we expected labor \u2014the labor supply\u2014labor market to come back quickly, and it didn\u2019 t.  And 2022 was a disappointing year, and, you know, we were kind of thinking, \u201cWell, maybe we won\u2019 t get it back. \u201d  And then 2023, we did, as you know \u2014so labor force participation came back strongly in \u2019 23, and so did immigration.  Immigration came to a halt during the pandemic. So\u2014and so those two forces have significantly lowered the temperature in the labor market to what is still a very strong labor market.  It\u2019 s still a good labor market for wages and for finding a job, but it \u2019s getting back into balance , and that \u2019s what we want to see.  And , you know, one great way to look at that is what \u2019s happening with, with  wage increases.  And you see it now across the, the  major things that we \u2014that we  track.  It isn \u2019t every quarter, but , overall , there \u2019s a clear trend \u2014still at high levels, but back down to where \u2014what would be consistent with, with where  we were before the pandemic and with 2 percent inflation. MICHELLE SMITH.  Chris. CHRIS TOPHER RUGABER.  Hi, Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.  Thank you.  I wanted to follow up on Rich\u2019 s question.  It sounded like you suggested that you\u2019 re not worried about faster growth so much\u2014s o wanted to see if you\u2019 re seeing anything that suggests that inflation could reaccelerate from here .  And it sounds like you \u2019re saying you\u2019 re not worried that solid growth from here on out poses any risk to inflation.  Thank you. CHAIR POWELL.  No, I think that that is a risk \u2014the risk that inflation would , would reaccelerate.  I think the , the greater risk is that it would \u2014that it would  stabilize at a level meaningfully above 2 percent.  That \u2019s, that\u2019s,  to me , more likely.  Of course, if \u2014if inflation were to surprise by moving back up, that would\u2014we would have to respond to that , and that would\u2014\n\nJanuary 31, 2024   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nthat would be a surprise at this point.  But I have to tell you, that \u2019s why we keep our options open here and why we \u2019re not , you know, rushing.  So I , I think both of those are risks, but I think the more likely risk is the one that I mentioned, which is , you\u2019 ve had six good months \u2014very good months \u2014but what, what \u2019s really going to \u201c shake out \u201d here?  You know, where \u2014what will\u2014 when we look back, what will we see?  Will , will  inflation have dipped and then come back up? Are the last six months flattered by factors that are \u2014that are  one-off factors that won \u2019t repeat themselves?  We don\u2019 t think so.  We don\u2019t \u2014you know, that \u2019s not what we think, but that \u2019s the question we are asking .  We have to ask  [that], and we want to get comfort on that. CHRIS TOPHER RUGABER.  And just one quick follow -up\u2014Governor Waller had mentioned the revisions that are coming on February 9th for the CPI data.  Is that something you\u2019re watching as well?  And if , if we see those revisions fairly minor, is that going to give you more confidence where things are going? CHAIR POWELL.  We\u2019 ll just have to see.  Yeah.  We\u2019 ll\u2014we look at those.  Last year was a\u2014was a, a surprise. MICHELLE SMITH.  Mike. MICHAEL MCKEE.  Michael McKee, Bloomberg Radio and Television.  If you don\u2019 t want to use the term \u201c soft landing,\u201d  would you say, at least , that, from your point of view now, the other scenario of a hard landing caused by the F ed is off the table or the risks have diminished very much?  And you mentioned below \u20132 percent inflation for \u2014on a three -month basis, core PCE has been running at 1 \u00bd percent.  And there are those on Wall Street who think that if you maintain the level of restriction you have right now, you could end up with inflation running below your target.  How do you see that?\n\nJanuary 31, 2024   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nCHAIR POWELL.  So , how to\u2014your first question\u2014how to describe where we are?   So I guess I would just say this \u2014executive summary would be that growth is solid to strong over the course of last year.  The labor market \u20143.7 percent unemployment indicates that the labor market is strong.  We\u2019 ve had just about two years now of , of unemployment under 4 percent. That hasn \u2019t happened in 50 years.  So it \u2019s a good labor market.  And we \u2019ve seen inflation come down.  We\u2019 ve talked about that.  So  we\u2019ve got six months of good inflation data and an expectati on that there \u2019s more to come.  So this is a \u2014this is a  good situation.  Let \u2019s be honest. This is a\u2014 this is a good economy. But what \u2019s the outlook?   That \u2019s looking in the re arview \u2014the outlook\u2014we do expect growth to moderate.  Of course, we have expected it for some time, and it hasn\u2019 t happened, but we do expect that it will moderate as supply chain and labor market normalization runs its course.  The l abor market is rebalancing , as, as I mentioned .  Job creation has slowed.  The base of job growth has narrowed.  And , of course, 12- month inflation is, is above target and getting, you know, getting down closer to target.  It \u2019s not guaranteed, but we do seem to be getting on track for that.   So those are the risks and , and questions we have to answer.  But , overall, this is a pretty good picture.  It, it is a good picture.  Your second question was \u2014sorry. MICHAEL MCKEE.  Could you get inflation that is below target \u2014end up with inflation below target , and you have to do something about that? CHAIR POWELL.  So we \u2014the thing is, we \u2019re not looking for inflation to tap the 2 percent base once.  We \u2019re looking for it to settle out over time at 2 percent.  And the same thing is true  if we have a month or two of lower \u2014and we have that now \u2014of, of inflation that \u2019s annualized at a \u2014at a lower level\u2014that wouldn\u2019 t be good.  We\u2019 re not \u2014you know, we\u2019re not looking to have inflation anchor below 2 percent.  We\u2019 re looking to have it anchor at 2  percent.\n\nJanuary 31, 2024   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nSo if we do face those circumstances, then we\u2019 ll have to deal with that.  I think \u2014I think as of now, you know, the , the question, which\u2014we want to take advantage of this situation and finish the job on inflation while keeping the labor market strong. MICHELLE SMITH.  Edward. EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Edward Lawrence from Fox Business.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking this.  So , as I \u2019ve\u2014as I\u2019ve  heard from some District F ed presidents, is it, in your view , a little premature to think that rate cuts are right around the corner?   And then when we do see that first rate cut, is that \u2014should we interpret that as the beginning of a rate -cut cycle, or is it a one -off? CHAIR POWELL.  So I \u2019ll point you to that language on your first question.  We, we included that language in the statement to signal clearly that \u2014with strong growth, strong labor market, inflation coming down \u2014the C ommittee intends to move carefully as we consider when to begin to dial back the restrictive stance that we have in place.  So if you take that to the current context \u2014current context, we\u2019re going to be data  dependent.  We\u2019re going to be looking at this meeting by meeting.  Based on the meeting toda y, I would tell you that I don\u2019 t think it\u2019 s likely that the Committee will reach a level of confidence by the time of the March meeting to identify March as the time to do that.  But that\u2019 s, that\u2019s  to be seen.  So I wouldn\u2019 t call \u2014you know, when you say \u2014when you ask me about \u201c in the near term, \u201d I\u2019m hearing that as March.  I would say I don\u2019t think that\u2019s \u2014that\u2019s, that\u2019s  probably not the most likely case or what we would call the base case.  And your second question is \u2014 EDWARD LAWRENCE.  On, on the \u2014is this the start of a \u2014when we see a cut, is it the start of a cutting cycle , or is it \u2014could it just be a one -off?\n\nJanuary 31, 2024   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nCHAIR POWELL.  You know, that \u2019s going to depend on the data.  The whole thing is, this is going to depend on the data.  We\u2019re going to be looking at the economic data as it affects the outlook and the balance of risks.  And we \u2019re going to make our decisions based on that.  And it could wind up\u2014you know, we \u2019ll, we\u2019ll have another SEP at the March meeting , and, and people will write down what they think.  But , in the end, it \u2019s really going to depend on how the economy evolves.  We talked about, there are risks that would cause us to go slower \u2014for example, stronger inflation\u2014more , more  persistent inflation.  There are risks that  would cause us to\u2014if they happen\u2014that would cause us to go faster or \u2014and sooner.  And that would be a weakening in the labor market or , for that matter, very, very persuasive lower inflation.  Those are the kinds of things.  So we \u2019re just \u2014we\u2019re just  going to be reacting to the data.  That \u2019s the\u2014 that\u2019s re ally the only way we can do this. MICHELLE SMITH.  Victoria. VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi.  Victoria Guid a with Politico.  Could you talk a little bit more about productivity growth?  You know, you\u2019 ve mentioned multiple times about, you know, the level of wage growth that\u2019 s consistent with 2 percent inflation.  We\u2019 ve obviously seen, you know \u2014you were talking about ECI this morning,  in which it \u2019s cooled a little bit but still sort of above what you wanted to see.  Growth has been very strong.  How much of those numbers do you attribute to productivity?  And do you see that productivity as sort of just temporary because of the factors\u2014the labor and supply chain factors you were talking about \u2014or do you think that productivity growth will , will fade over time? CHAIR POWELL.  So this is a really interesting question.  And I think\u2014 my, my own view is \u2014I think if you look, look back to the pandemic, you , you saw a spike in productivity as workers were laid off , and , and activity didn\u2019 t decline as fast.  And then you saw a deep trough\n\nJanuary 31, 2024   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nof productivity.  And then, over the last \u2014you saw high productivity last year , in \u201923.  I think we\u2019re, we\u2019re  basically in the throes of getting through the pandemic economy.  And the question will be, what, what is it that has changed the\u2014you know, the productivity tends to be based on, you know, fundamental aspects of our economy.  Is there \u2014is there a case\u2014will it be the case that we come out of this more productive on a sustained basis?  And I don\u2019 t know.  I don\u2019t know. What would it take?  It would take \u2014you know, people talk about AI, but I would\u2014 my guess is that we may shake out and be back where we were, because I don\u2019t \u2014I\u2019m not sure I see\u2014work from home doesn\u2019 t seem like it \u2019s a big productivity increase .  Or AI, artificial intelligence \u2014 generative  it may  be, but probably not in the short run\u2014probably, maybe in the longer run.  So I\u2019m not \u2014I\u2019m not seeing why it would, but , you know, right \u2014you know, right now I would say that productivity is kind of what falls out of the , the broader forces that are driving people in and out of the labor force and , and activity returning and supply chains getting fixed. VICTORIA GUIDA.   Right.  So would that be behind why we \u2019ve seen such strong growth, but we \u2019ve also seen inflation fall \u2014that maybe there \u2019s just a higher level of productivity? CHAIR POWELL.  That \u2019s one way to look at it.  Yeah. MICHELLE SMITH.  Nancy.  NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Nancy Marshall -Genzer with Marketplace.  I want to ask a little bit more about housing.  I \u2019m wondering\u2014how closely are you watching rent and housing prices as you evaluate whether and when to cut rates?  And it seems like housing prices are not coming down as quickly as you expected. CHAIR POWELL.  So when we think about, you know \u2014our , our statutory goals are maximum employment and price stability, and that \u2019s what we \u2019re targeting.  We\u2019 re not targeting housing price inflation, the cost of housing, or any of those things.  Those are very important\n\nJanuary 31, 2024   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nthings for people \u2019s lives.  But they\u2019re not \u2014you know, those are not the things we \u2019re targeting. We\u2019re also well aware that when we cut rates at the beginning of the pandemic, for example, the housing, housing industry was helped more than any other industry.  And when we raise rates, the housing industry can be hurt , because it \u2019s a very interest -sensitive sector. On top of that, we have longer -run problems with the availability of housing.  You know, we have a, a  built -up set of cities , and, and, you know, people are moving further and further out. So there \u2019s\u2014there hasn \u2019t been enough housing built.  And these are not \u2014these are not  things that we have any tools to address.  But , you know, where it comes into play very specifically in our work is inflation, which is a combination.  It \u2019s, it\u2019s really rental inflation.  You\u2019re taking owners \u2019 equivalent rent and then ac tual rent paid by tenants.  And you\u2019 re, you\u2019re  running that through the CPI calculation .  Or the PCE [inflation] calculation \u2014the one we look at.  And what that \u2019s telling you is that market rents are increasing at a much lower rate or even being flat and that that will show up in inflation over time.  It has to as long as that remains the case. NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.   And just real quick\u2014what is your response to the letter that was sent to you by some members of Congress asking the F ed to lower interest rates to make housing more affordable? CHAIR POWELL.  My response is what I started with, which is that our , our job\u2014the job Congress has given us is price stability and maximum employment.  Price stability is absolutely essential for people \u2019s lives, m ost importantly for \u2014well, not most importantly\u2014 most, mostly for people at the lower end of the income spectrum who are living at the edges \u2014at the margins.  And so someone \u2014for someone like that, high inflation in the \u2014in the  necessities of life\u2014right away , you\u2019 re in trouble, whereas even middle -class  people have  some , you know, some scope to absorb higher costs.  So we have to get \u2014it\u2019s our job.  It\u2019s what society has asked\n\nJanuary 31, 2024   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nus to do, is to get inflation down , and t he tools that we use to do it are interest rates.  So that \u2019s how we think about that. MICHELLE SMITH.  Court enay. COURTENAY BROWN.  Court enay Brown from Axios.  Can you give us some insight into whether the C ommittee discussed the possibility of slowing balance sheet runoff in the months ahead? CHAIR POWELL.   Yes.  So I would start by saying that balance sheet runoff so far has gone very well.  And as the process has continued, you know, we \u2019re getting to that time where questions are beginning to come into greater focus about the pace of runoff and all that.  So at this meeting, we did have some discussion of the balance sheet, and we \u2019re planning to begin in - depth discussions of balance sheet issues at our next meeting in March.  So those , those questions are all coming into scope now, and we \u2019re focusing on them.  But we \u2019re, we\u2019re  at the beginning of that process, I would say. COURTENAY BROWN.  Quick follow -up\u2014i s it the case that the F ed would decide to lower rates and make adjustments to the balance sheet runoff in tandem? CHAIR POWELL.   Yes, we  do\u2014we see those as independent tools.  And so  they don\u2019t \u2014for example, if you \u2019re\u2014if you\u2019re  normalizing policy, you might be reducing rates but continuing to run off the balance sheet.  In both cases, that \u2019s normalization, but from a strict monetary policy standpoint, you could say we \u2019re loosening along with tightening.  So that , that could happen.  It\u2019 s not something we \u2019re planning or thinking about , but right now, we \u2019re thinking about getting to a place where \u2014we \u2019re going to see the balance sheet runoff to continue. We\u2019re watching it carefully, and, as I said, we\u2019 ll\u2014we\u2019ll be  looking into that as a C ommittee starting in March.\n\nJanuary 31, 2024   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nCOURTENAY BROWN.  Thanks. MICHELLE SMITH.  Simon. SIMON RABINOVITCH.  Simon Rabinovitch with t he Economist.  Thank you, Chair Powell.  You \u2019ve mentioned six good months of inflation data, but that not being enough to build up confidence.  Based on your previous response that your base case is you probably wouldn\u2019 t start easing yet in March, the implication is that eight good months might not be enough, either. Roughly how many months do you think you might need of , of good inflation  data to be \u2014to be confident? CHAIR POWELL.  I \u2019m, I\u2019m not in a position to put a number on it.  I \u2019m just going to say\u2014and it \u2019s not that we don\u2019 t have any confidence.  We, we  have growing confidence, but not to the point where we \u2014where we  feel like \u2014it\u2019s a highly consequential decision to start the process of , of dialing back on restriction.  And w e want to get that right, and we feel like the strong economy, strong labor market, inflation coming down\u2014it gives us the ability to do that. We think that \u2019s the best way we can serve the public, because , ultimately, we, we \u2019ve made a lot of progress on inflation.  We just want to make sure that we do get the job done in a sustainable way.  That \u2019s how we \u2019re thinking about it.  In terms of when that \u2019ll be, you know, that, that \u2019ll all come out of our communications, and , you know, we won\u2019t \u2014we won \u2019t keep that a secret. MICHELLE SMITH.  Evan . EVAN RYSER.   Hi, Chair Powell .  Evan R yser with MNI Market News.  Can you explain a little bit more on what you\u2019 re considering when tapering QT?  Do you need to see the overnight reverse repo facility all the way down to zero, or is it something that you can start with a couple hundred billion dollars there?\n\nJanuary 31, 2024   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nCHAIR POWELL.  Not a decision that we \u2019ve made, but I , I wouldn\u2019 t think we \u2019d, we\u2019d be\u2014we wouldn\u2019t be taking a position that it \u2019s got to go to zero.  I mean, if it\u2014if it  were to stabilize at a different level\u2014but that \u2019s, that\u2019s  not a decision that we \u2019ve made.  That \u2019s, that\u2019s what we \u2019ll be talking about at the March meeting.  A whole range of issues will be briefed up, and the C ommittee will get into \u2014get into  all of the issues that will be arising over the course of the next, let \u2019s say, year or so. MICHELLE SMITH.  Greg . GREG ROBB.  Thanks.  Greg Robb from MarketWatch.  Chair Powell, I want to change gears a little bit.  In the presidential primary campaign that\u2019 s been going on for the last nine months or so, your name has come up often, and many Republican candidates ha d said that they probably wouldn\u2019 t want to give you a third term.  So I wanted to give you a chance to talk about that.  Do you want another term \u2014you\u2019ve had\u2014 on the F ed?  What , what \u2019s your stance on that? CHAIR POWELL.   I don\u2019 t have a stance on that.  It\u2019 s not something I\u2019 m focused on. [We\u2019re] focused on doing our jobs.  We have\u2014t his year is going to be a highly consequential year for , for the F ed and for monetary policy.  A nd we \u2019re, all of us , very buckled down, focused on doing our jobs. MICHELLE SMITH.   Jennifer. JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.  Thank you, Chair Powell.  Jennifer Schonberger with Yahoo Finance.  As you mentioned, core PCE  [inflation] has been running at 1.9 percent over the past six months .  And you guys are actually expecting core inflation higher this year , at 2.4 percent , compared to that six -month measure.  Given that forecast and that the median is for three rate cuts this year, what happens if inflation stays where it \u2019s been over the last six months for the next six months?\n\nJanuary 31, 2024   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nCHAIR POWELL.  So I \u2014you know, we\u2019re going to do\u2014w e\u2019ll update our , our inflation forecasts at the next meeting.  You referred to the December meeting.  That \u2019s, that\u2019s, you know, three months old  [by March] , so it might be lower now , given the data we \u2019ve gotten.  So , look, as I mentioned, we \u2019re going to be reacting to the data.  If, if  we get \u2014if we get  very strong inflation data and it , it kicks back up, then it\u2019ll\u2014then we \u2019ll go slower or later or both.  If we got really good inflation data soon, that would matter for both the \u2014that, that would  tell us that, that  we could go sooner and perhaps go faster.  So we\u2019re just going to be \u2014but , of course, we \u2019ll weigh that with all the other factors.  We \u2019re setting policy based on the totality of , of the data. JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.   But just to follow \u2014if inflation stays where it is currently, that would probably mean that the real interest rate becomes more restrictive.  Would that mean you\u2019d have to trim more, perhaps, than you already have factored in? CHAIR POWELL.   Well, I think if we \u2014if we  came to the view that , that inflation were \u2014that the six -month inflation numbers, which are very close to 2 [percent] , were , in \u201c PCE world \u201d\u2014if we came to \u2014if that\u2019s \u2014if we thought that is really where we \u2019re going to be, then, yes, our policy would be in a different place.  It would.  But , you know, that \u2019s the whole point is , we\u2019re trying to get comfortable and gain confidence that that is where \u2014that inflation is on a sustainable path down to 2 percent or toward 2 percent. MICHELLE SMITH.  Daniel. DANIEL AVIS.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Daniel Avis, Agence France- Presse.  I just wondered if I could get your comment on the recent consumer confidence data.  It seems to suggest that consumers are sort of moving towards a much more optimistic view of the economy.  I just wonder \u2014is it fair to say that they \u2019re moving towards where the Fed appears to have been in\n\nJanuary 31, 2024   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nrecent months?  And , you know, do you think that inflation and falling inflation perhaps has played a role in that?  And what challenges do you see , going forward?  Thank you. CHAIR POWELL.  Yeah, so it \u2019s been \u2014it\u2019s been  interesting that confidence surveys have been weak , at a time when unemployment has been low \u2014very low, historically low \u2014for a couple of years.  And \u2014but , nonetheless, that \u2019s been the case.  And we \u2019ve asked ourselves why that is.  And , you know, one obvious answer \u2014we don\u2019 t pretend to have perfect wisdom on this\u2014is\u2014but one obvious answer is that the price level  is high.  So  prices went up much more than 2 percent for year \u2014per year for a couple of years.  And people are going to the store, and they\u2019 re paying much more for the basics of life than they were two years ago\u2014three years ago. And they\u2019 re not happy about it.  And it \u2019s fine that inflation is coming down, but the price \u2014the prices they \u2019re paying are still high. So that , that is what \u2014that, that has to be some part of why people are unhappy.  And they\u2019 re, they\u2019re  right to be unhappy.  You know, t his is why we need to keep price stability.  It \u2019s why we need to do our jobs \u2014so that people don\u2019 t have to deal with things like this. In terms of [surveys] \u2014you\u2019re right.  In, in recent , recent  surveys, a couple of \u2014you\u2019 ve seen a couple of significant increases in , in consumer confidence or , or happiness with the economy.  I guess that \u2019s a good thing.  That can \u2014that can  support spending\u2014can support economic activity.  There \u2019s some evidence of that.   But it is \u2014it is  a fact that we have seen , you know, a meaningful increase.   I think levels of confidence are still maybe not as high as they\u2019 ve been at various times.  But it\u2019s \u2014they certainly have come up. MICHELLE SMITH.  Bryan . BRYAN MENA.  Thank you for taking our questions.  B ryan Mena , CNN Business. Committee members have said they \u2019d like to meet with business leaders and stakeholders in\n\nJanuary 31, 2024   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nperson to learn more about the economy in real time, given that some data is subject to large revisions, the issue of seasonal adjustments being thrown off balance, and many readings of the economy being quarterly.  So did any members say they\u2019 ve learned anything not reflected in the data?  Or have you yourself learned anything through anecdotal evidence that hasn\u2019 t been captured in the data yet? CHAIR POWELL.  Well, yes.  I\u2019m, I\u2019m a big believer that\u2014 yes.  So we , we do meet with outside groups who come from all different parts of the economy.  And I always feel like you\u2014I mean, I spent most of my life in the private sector looking at companies \u2014individual companies \u2014individual management teams \u2014and then building out from that. And so,  starting with GDP data is \u2014and working into what \u2019s actually affecting people \u2019s lives is\u2014is  challenging. It\u2019s very hard.  So I , I really like anecdotal data.   In addition, as you know, the 12 R eserve B anks have really the best network of anyone.  In all their D istricts, they \u2019re talking to , you know, not just the business community, but the educational, medical, all, all\u2014you know, nonprofit community.   They have arms into all of that.  And so when they come back \u2014that \u2019s what goes into the Beige Book.  But they come back, and what each R eserve B ank president does is, during the outlook go- around, they \u2019ll say, \u201cI n my D istrict  . . .\u201d   And they\u2019 ll talk about 100 conversations they\u2014not \u2014they won\u2019t talk\u2014t hey, they will give you input , based on 100 conversations that they\u2019 ve had with people of all different walks.  And it\u2019s \u2014I personally find it very helpful in understanding what \u2019s going on.  And also, I think you hear things before they show up in the data sometimes. BRYAN MENA.   Did any of them \u2014did any of them  notice slowing economy based on what they\u2019 ve heard from, like, their D istrict?\n\nJanuary 31, 2024   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nCHAIR POWELL.   Yes.  I mean, if you\u2014if you look back at the last \u2014not this Beige Book, but the one before , it was more \u2014there was a lot of \u201c slower activity. \u201d  I think that , that what you\u2019 re hearing now is , is, things are picking up a bit.  You\u2019re hearing \u2014not , not in every District and not every , every person that we talk to, but  you\u2019re \u2014overall, it feels like you \u2019re hearing things picking up at the margin.  So that \u2019s what comes through. MICHELLE SMITH.   Let\u2019s go to Jeff Cox for the last question. JEFF COX.   Thank you, sir.  Jeff Cox from CNBC.com.  Just kind of looking to put it all together :  You talked about basically the , the economy looking strong with 3.3 percent annualized growth in the fourth quarter.  Does the strength of the economy speak more loudly to you now than any inflation threat might?  That, you know \u2014you\u2019 re in a position, in other words, to keep rates elevated as long as the economy stays strong, and you\u2019 re more \u2014you\u2019 re more  tilted towards that.  And also, perhaps, are you worried at all that the economy is maybe a little too strong right now and that inflation could come back at some point? CHAIR POWELL.  I \u2019m not so worried about that.  You know, it\u2019s \u2014again, we \u2019ve had inflation come down without a slow economy and without , you know, important increases in , in unemployment, and there \u2019s no reason why we should want to get in the way of that process , if it\u2019s going to continue.  So I , I am \u2014you know, I  think\u2014I think  declining inflation \u2014continued declines in inflation  are, are really the main thing we \u2019re looking at.  Of course, we want the labor market to remain strong, too. We don\u2019 t have a growth mandate.  We \u2019ve got a , a maximum -employment mandate and a , a price -stability mandate, and those are the two things we look at.  Growth only matters to the extent it influences our achievement of those two\u2014of those two mandates. Thank you very much."

My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. The economy has made considerable  progress toward our dual -mandate objectives.  Inflation has eased substantially  while the labor market has remained strong , and that  is very good news.  But inflation is still too high, ongoing progress in bringing it down is not assured, and the path forward is uncertain.  We are fully committed to returning inflation to  our 2  percent goal. Restoring price stability is essential to achieve a sustainably strong labor market that benefit s all. Today, the  FOMC  decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings.  Our restrictive stance of monetary policy has been putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation.   As labor market tightness has eased and progress on inflation has continued, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals are moving into better balance .  I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments. Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a solid  pace. GDP growth in the fourth quarter of last year came in at 3.2 percent.  For 2023 as a whole, GDP expanded 3.1 percent , bolstered by strong consumer demand as well as improving supply conditions.  Activity in the housing sector was subdued over the past year , largely reflecting high mortgage rates.  High interest rates also appear to have weigh ed on business fixed investment.  In our Summary of Economic Projections, Committee participants generally expect GDP growth  to slow  from last year\u2019s pace , with a median projection of 2.1 percent this year and 2 percent over the next two years.  Participants generally revised up their growth projections since December, reflecting the strength of incoming data, including data on labor supply.\n\nMarch 20, 2024  Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nThe labor market remains relatively tight, but supply and demand conditions continue to come into better balance.  Over the past three months, payroll job gains averaged 265,000 jobs per month.  The unemployment rate  has edged up but  remains low at 3.9 percent.  Strong job creation has been accompanied by an increase in the supply of workers , reflecting increases in participation among individuals aged 25 to 54 years and a continued strong pace of immigration. Nominal wage growth  has been easing, and job v acancies have declined.  Although the jobs -to- workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply of available workers.   FOMC participants expect the rebalancing in the labor market to continue, easing upward pressure on inflation.   The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP is 4.0 percent at the end of this year and 4.1 percent at the end of next year. Inflation has eased notably over the past year but remains above our longer -run goal of 2 percent.  Estimates based on the consumer price index and other data indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.5 percent over the 12 months ending in February and that, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent.   Longer -term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters as well as  from  measures from financial markets.   The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation falls to 2.4 percent  this year , 2.2 percent next year,  and 2 percent in 2026. The Fed\u2019s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.  My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, espe cially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.  We are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.\n\nMarch 20, 2024  Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nThe Committee decided at today\u2019s meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5 \u00bc to 5\u00bd percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings.  As labor market tightness has eased and progress on inflation has continued, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals are coming into better balance.  We believe that our policy rate is likely at its peak for this tightening cycle  and that, if the economy evolves broadly as expected, it will likel y be appropriate to begin dialing back policy restraint at some point  this year.  The economic outlook is uncertain, however, and we remain highly attentive to inflation risks.  We are prepared to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for longer, if appropriate. We know that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could result in a reversal of the progress we have seen on inflation and ultimately require even tighter policy to get inflation back to 2 percent.  At the same time, reducing policy restraint too  late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment.  In considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.  Th e Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably  down toward 2 percent.  Of course, we\u2019re committed to both sides of our dual mandate , and  an unexpected weakening in the labor market could also warrant a policy response.   We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting. In our SEP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an appropriate path for the federal funds rate based on what each participant judges to be the most likely scenario going forward.   If the economy evolves as projected, the median participant projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 4.6 percent at the end of this\n\nMarch 20, 2024  Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nyear, 3.9 percent at the end of 2025, and 3.1 percent at the end of 2026 , still above the medium \u2014 median longer -term funds rate.  These projections are not a Committee decision or plan; if the economy does not evolve as projected, the path for policy will adjust as appropriate to foster our maximum -employment and price -stability goals. Turning to our balance sheet, our securities holdings have declined by nearly $1.5  trillion since the Committee  began reducing our portfolio .  At this meeting, we discussed issues related to slowing the pace of decline in our securities holdings.  While we did not make any decisions today on this , the general sense of the Committee is that it will be appropriate to slow the pace of runoff fairly soon , consistent with the plans we previously issued.   The decision to slow the pace of runoff does not mean that our balance sheet will ultimately shrink by less  than it would otherwise  but rather allows us to approach that ultimate level more gradually.  In particular, slowing the pace of runoff will help ensure a smooth transition , reducing the possibility that money markets experience stress and thereby facilitating the ongoing decline in our securities holdings  consistent with reaching the appropriate level of ample reserves . We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keeping our longer -term inflation expectations well anchored.  Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and price stability  over the long term. To conclude :  We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country.  Everything we do is in service to our public mission.  We , at the Fed, will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals. Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH.  Steve .\n\nMarch 20, 2024  Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nSTEVE LIESMAN.  Steve Liesman, CNBC.   Mr. Chairman, the projections show somewhat higher core inflation .  They also show somewhat stronger growth.  What should we infer from this notion that, on average , rates were kept the same this year , but inflation is higher and growth is higher.  Does it mean more tolerance for higher inflation and less of a willingness to slow the economy to achieve that target? CHAIR POWELL.  Well, it doesn \u2019t\u2014no, it doesn \u2019t mean that.  What it means is that , you know,  we\u2019ve seen incoming \u2014as I pointed out in my opening remarks, we did mark  up our growth forecast and so have many other forecasters, so the economy is performing , performing well.  And the inflation data came in a little bit higher is a separate matter , and I think that caused people to write up their inflation .  But nonetheless, we continue to make good progress on bringing inflation down .  And so \u2014 STEVE LIESMAN.  When you \u2014just to follow  up:  When you say that you \u2019re willing to either maintain the rate for longer, is \u2014what is the tolerance of the Federal Reserve for inflation coming in above its 2 percent target? CHAIR POWELL.  We\u2019re strongly committed to bringing inflation down to 2 percent over time.  That is \u2014that is our goal , and we will achieve that goal.  Markets believe we will achieve that goal .  And they should believe that, because that \u2019s what \u2014that\u2019s what will happen over time.  But we stress \u201cover time. \u201d  And so I think we \u2019re, we\u2019re  making projections that do show that happening .  And we \u2019re committed to that outcome , and we will bring it about. MICHELLE SMITH.  Rachel. RACHEL SIEGEL.  Hi, Chair Powell .  Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.   Thanks for taking our questions.  You and other s have been saying that relief on housing inflation is\n\nMarch 20, 2024  Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\ncoming, but it still hasn \u2019t shown up meaningfully in the CPI or the PCE.  Does that challenge your assumption about when the shift will finally break through , since it hasn \u2019t at that point ? CHAIR POWELL.  So I think there \u2019s some confidence that the market rents \u2014lower market rent increases that we \u2019re seeing will show up in measures of housing services inflation over time.  There \u2019s a little bit of uncertainty about when that will happen , but there \u2019s real confidence that they will show up eventually over time.  But, again, uncertainty about the exact timing of that . RACHEL SIEGEL.  Okay.   And will you be able to get overall inflation down to target if housing doesn \u2019t break through quickly, and does that affect the timing for eventual cuts this year? CHAIR POWELL.  We will get aggregate inflation down to 2 percent over time.  We will.  And, and  I would assume that we \u2019ll continue to see is \u2014we\u2019ll see goods prices coming into a new equilibrium where they \u2019re going down  perhaps not as quickly as they had been earlier this year, where housing services inflation will come back down as , as current market rents are suggesting will happen and where nonhousing services will move back down.  Some combination of those three things \u2014and it may be different from the combination we had before the pandemic \u2014will be achieved and will bring inflation back down to 2 percent sustainably. MICHELLE SMITH.  Nick. NICK TIMIRAOS.  Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.   Chair Powell, during your congressional testimony this month, you said that your test for making the first change to interest rates does not require you to be terribly comfortable that inflation is at 2 percent because interest rates are well  above neutral.  At the same time, you said here after the last meeting that the first cut is highly consequential.  Can you reconcile these views for me?   If rates are well  above\n\nMarch 20, 2024  Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nneutral, why would the first cut be highly consequential?  Is that because you anticipate one cut would be followed by one or two more along the lines of the recalibration you made in 2019, which itself was modeled on the mid -cycle adjustment of 1995? CHAIR POWELL.  It\u2019s more \u2014I would put it more in the context of what I said in our \u2014 in my opening remarks that the risks are really two -sided here .  We\u2014we\u2019re in a situation where , you know, if we ease \u2014if we ease  too much or too soon, we could see inflation come back, and if we ease too late, we could do unnecessary harm to employment and people \u2019s working lives.  And so, you know, we do see the risks as two -sided, so it is consequential .  We want to be careful . And, fortunately , with the economy growing, with the labor market strong, and with inflation coming down, we can approach that question carefully and let the data speak on that.  That\u2019s really what I was thinking. NICK TIMIRAOS.  How much of that inflation that we \u2019ve seen so far this year do you chalk up to one -off calendar adjustment effects following a period of high inflation versus some change in the trend we saw  in the second half of last year? CHAIR POWELL.  I want to start by being \u2014saying I always try to be careful about dismissing data that we don \u2019t like.   So you need to check yourself on that , and I \u2019ll do that .  But\u2014 so I would say the January number, which was very high \u2014the January CPI and PCE numbers were quite high .  There\u2019s reason to think that there could be seasonal effects there.  But, nonetheless, we don \u2019t want to be completely dismissive of it.  The February number was high, higher than expectations, but we have it at currently well below 30 basis points core PCE, which is not terribly high.  So it\u2019s not like the January number.   But I take the two of them together , and I think they haven \u2019t really changed the overall story , which is that of inflation moving down gradually on a sometimes -bumpy road toward  2 percent.   I don \u2019t think that story has changed.  I\n\nMarch 20, 2024  Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nalso don \u2019t think that those readings added to anyone \u2019s confidence that we \u2019re moving closer to , to that point .  But, you know,  we didn \u2019t\u2014the last thing I \u2019ll say is we didn \u2019t excessively celebrate the good inflation readings we got in the last seven months of last year.  We didn \u2019t take too much signal out of that .  What you heard us saying was that we needed to see more that we could , you know \u2014we wanted to be careful about that decision , and we \u2019re not going to overreact , as well , to these two months of data, nor are we going to ignore them. MICHELLE SMITH.  Ann. ANN SAPHIR.  Hi, yes , Chair Powell.   Could you speak a little bit more about the timing?  Is there enough data between now and , say, May to be able to get the kind of confidence that you say you still need ?  Or, by June , is there enough data for you?   Just give us a sense of your thinking there.  Thank you. CHAIR POWELL.  Yeah .  So we make decisions meeting by meeting .  And we didn \u2019t make any decisions about future meetings today.   Those are going to depend on our ongoing assessment of the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.  So I really don \u2019t have anything for you on any specific meeting , looking forward. ANN SAPHIR.   I mean just a question of \u2014I mean , is there even enough data for you to be able to \u2014 CHAIR POWELL.  We\u2019ll take \u2014you know, things can happen during an inter meeting period , if you look back \u2014unexpected things.  So I don \u2019t want to \u2014I wouldn \u2019t want to dismiss anything.   So I just would say that the Committee wants to see more data that gives us higher confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward 2 percent.  I also mentioned \u2014and we don \u2019t see this in the data right now, but if there were a significant weakening in the data, particularly in the labor market, that could also be a reason for us to begin the process of\n\nMarch 20, 2024  Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nreducing rates .  Again, I don \u2019t\u2014there \u2019s nothing in the data pointing at that , but those are the things that we \u2019ll be looking at , at coming meetings and \u2014without trying to refer to any specific meeting. MICHELLE SMITH.  Chris. CHRIS TOPHER  RUGABER.  Hi, Chris Rugaber, the Associated Press.  Thank you.  In the projections , there is an increase in the neutral rate , as you know, and higher rates \u2014\u00bc point higher rates projected in 2025, 2026.   Can you speak about why, [ what ] might be behind that?  Is there a real sense here that the economy has perhaps changed in some way that higher rates will be needed in the future?  Thank you. CHAIR POWELL.  So you \u2019re right.  They \u2019re pretty modes t changes , but you \u2019re right . There was an uptick in the longer -run rate, and also there \u2019s a 25 basis point increase in  \u201925 and \u201926.  In terms of , are rates going to be higher in the longer run, if that \u2019s really your question, I don\u2019t think we know that.  I think it \u2019s, it\u2019s\u2014we think that rates were generally low during the pre-pandemic post \u2013Global Financial Crisis era for reasons that are mostly , you know,  important, slow -moving , large things like demographics and productivity and that sort of thing \u2014things that don\u2019t move quickly.  But I don \u2019t think we know.  I mean , my instinct would be that rates will not go back down to the very low levels that we saw , where , all around the world , there were long - run [real interest] rates that were at or below zero in some cases.  I don \u2019t see rates going back down to that level .  But I think there \u2019s tremendous uncertainty around that. CHRIS RUGABER.  Great, and just a quick follow [-up].  On the projections , you also have 2. 6 percent core inflation for the end of this year.  It\u2019s already at \u2014or you mentioned it being 2.8 in February .  I mean , that doesn \u2019t sound like much disinflation at all.   So are you really , are you still confident or \u2014at the last press conference , you sounded pretty optimistic [that] you\n\nMarch 20, 2024  Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nwould get more confidence at the end of this year.  Is it right to say that this suggests you \u2019re not seeing a lot of disinflation this year compared to what we \u2019ve seen 2023 and so forth? CHAIR POWELL.  I think that that higher year -end number reflects the data we \u2019ve seen so far this year  because you \u2019re now \u2014you\u2019re now in this year .  So I think that \u2014sorry, say your last part of your question again. CHRIS RUGABER.   Are you still optimistic that you \u2019ll get the confidence you need this year? CHAIR POWELL.  I, you know , I think , if you look at the SEP, what it says is that it is still likely in most people \u2019s view that we will achieve that confidence and that there will be rate cuts.  But that \u2019s really going to depend on the incoming data .  It is.  The other thing is, in the second half of the year , you have some pretty low readings , so it might be harder to make progress as you move that 12 -month window forward.  Nonetheless, we \u2019re looking for data that confirm the kind of low readings that we had last year and give us a higher degree of confidence that what we saw was really inflation moving sustainably down to 2 percent \u2014toward 2 percent. JEANNA SMIALEK.  Jeanna Smialek, the New York Times.   Thank you for taking our questions.   Per your comment to Ann that a weakening in the labor market would be a reason to potentially cut rates or at least a consideration in making a rate cut, would continued strength in the labor market be a reason to hold off on rate cuts ?  And just in general, if labor supply continued to rebound in 2024, the way it did in 2023, what would stronger hiring and possibly stronger growth mean for the path forward on policy? CHAIR POWELL.  Yeah .  So, so, if what we \u2019re getting is a lot of supply and a lot of demand , and that supply is actually feeding demand because workers are getting paid and they \u2019re spending and that \u2019s, you know \u2014what you would have is potentially kind of what you had last\n\nMarch 20, 2024  Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nyear, which is a bigger economy where inflationary pressures are not increasing.  In fact, they were decreasing .  So you can have that if you have a continued supply -side activity that we had last year with \u2014both with supply ch ains and also with , with growth in the size of the labor force. JEANNA SMIALEK.  But\u2014so strong hiring in and of itself would not be a reason to hold off on rate cuts? CHAIR POWELL.  No, not all by itself .  No .  I mean , we saw \u2014you saw last year very strong hiring and inflation coming down quickly.  We now have a better sense that a big part of that was supply -side healing, particularly with , with growth in the labor force.   So, in and of itself, strong job growth is not a reason , you know,  for us to be concerned about inflation. MICHELLE SMITH.  Neil. NEIL IRWIN.  Hi, Chair Powell .  Neil Irwin with Axios.  How do you assess the state of financial conditions right now , and particularly \u2014in particular , do you view the kind of easing  in financial conditions since the fall as consistent and compatible with what you \u2019re trying to achieve on the inflation mandate? CHAIR POWELL.  So we think \u2014there are many different financial conditions indicators , and you can kind of , you know,  see different answers to that question.  But, ultimately, we do think that financial conditions are weighing on economic activity , and we think you see that in \u2014a great place to see it is in the labor market , where you \u2019ve seen demand cooling off a little bit from the extremely high levels .  And there I would point to job openings, quits, surveys, the hiring rate .  Things like that are really demand.  There are also supply -side things happening, but I think those are demand -side things happening.  You know, w e saw\u2014that\u2019s been a question for a while .  We did see progress on inflation last year \u2014significant progress , despite financial conditions sometimes being tighter, sometimes looser.\n\nMarch 20, 2024  Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nMICHELLE SMITH.  Mike. MICHAEL MCKEE.  Michael McKee with Bloomberg Radio and Television.  Can you give us more color on how the Committee is thinking about inflation dynamics now?  What we\u2019ve seen at the beginning of the year, are they more one -off increases that will fade , or is there more of a secular turn with goods prices rising again and service prices staying sticky ?  And also housing prices have been sort of the  Godot of this cycle , in that you keep expecting them to go down , and they don \u2019t.  How does the Committee see this playing out forward, since you \u2019ve raised your inflation forecast? CHAIR POWELL.  So I see the Committee looking at the two months of data and asking the same question you \u2019re asking and saying we \u2019re just going to have to see what the data show. As I mentioned, you can look at January, which is a very high reading and you can \u2014and I think many people did see the possibility of seasonal adjustment problems there .  But, again, you don \u2019t want to \u2014you\u2019ve got to be careful about dismissing the parts of the data that you don \u2019t like.  So then February wasn \u2019t, wasn\u2019t  as high, but it was higher.   So the question is, what are we going to see?  You know, w e tend to see a little bit stronger \u2014this is in the data \u2014a little bit stronger inflation in the first half of the year, a little bit less strong later in the year.   We\u2019re going to \u2014 we\u2019re going to let the data show.   I don\u2019t think we really know whether this is a bump on the road or something more.  We\u2019ll have to find out.  In the meantime, the economy is strong , the labor market is strong , inflation has come way down, and that gives us the ability to approach this question carefully and feel more confident that inflation is moving down sustainably at 2 percent when we take that step to begin dialing back our restrictive policy.\n\nMarch 20, 2024  Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nMICHAEL MCKEE.  Well , you\u2019ve talked about the desire to have confidence that inflation is continually moving down.  Have the recent numbers we \u2019ve gotten for inflation data dented that confidence at all? CHAIR POWELL.  It certainly hasn \u2019t improved our confidence \u2014it hasn\u2019t  raised anyone \u2019s confidence .  But I would say that the story is really essentially the same and that is of inflation coming down gradually toward 2 percent on a sometimes -bumpy path, as I mentioned. I think that \u2019s what you still see.  We\u2019ve got nine months of 2 \u00bd percent inflation now , and we \u2019ve had two months of kind of bumpy inflation.  We were saying that we \u2019ll\u2014it\u2019s going to be a bumpy ride.  We consistently said that.  Now here are some bumps , and the question is , are they more than bumps?  And we just don \u2019t\u2014we can \u2019t know that.  That\u2019s why we are approaching this question carefully .  It is very important for everyone that we serve that we do get inflation sustainably down .  And I think the historical record, it \u2019s\u2014every situation is different , but the historical record is that you need to approach that question carefully and try to get it right the first time and not have to come back and raise rates again perhaps if you cut inappropriately \u2014 prematurely. MICHELLE SMITH.  Go to Edward. EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Edward Lawrence with FOX Business.  I wanted to ask you, you received a letter from \u2014well, the Federal Reserve is an independent body , understanding Congress has oversight over that.   You received a letter from Senators Elizabeth Warren and Sheldon Whitehouse that said \u2014calling on you to lower interest rates \u2014to cut interest rates because this has \u201cthe potential that it  may remain too high for too long, has halted advances in deploying renewable energy technologies and delayed significant climate and economic benefits from these projects. \u201d  So has higher interest rates caused that?\n\nMarch 20, 2024  Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nCHAIR POWELL.  Have they \u2014well, first of all, I respect our \u2014you know, in our system of government , it is Congress that has oversight responsibility over the Fed.  We place a tremendous amount of importance on our engagements with Congress and always treat them with great respect.   In this case, I would say, those are , you know \u2014our mandate is for maximum employment and price stability and the other things that we do , and that \u2019s what we \u2019re trying to accomplish.  We\u2019re trying to do that in a way that sustains the strong growth we \u2019re seeing, the strong labor market we \u2019re seeing, but allows us to make further progress with inflation.   That\u2019s how we can best serve the public and leave the other issues, which in many cases are incredibly important, such as those you mentioned, leave those to the people who have responsibility for those. EDWARD LAWRENCE.  There was another letter from two dozen lawmakers saying that the higher rates are squeezing the working people.  How do these letters affect what you guys are doing , policy -wise? CHAIR POWELL.  We receive these letters with respect , and we write careful responses and address concerns .  We listen, again, because we \u2019re talking to the people who , in our system of government , have oversight over our activity.  So that \u2019s\u2014but at the end of the day, we take that on  board , but we have to make our judgments , and we have to \u201cstick to our knitting \u201d\u2014 which is maximum employment, price stability, supervise and regulate the banks, work on the payment system :  the things that we do. MICHELLE SMITH.  Claire. CLAIRE JONES.  Thank you.  Claire Jones, Financial Times.   Thanks a lot for the opportunity to ask a question.  As Chair of the FOMC, would you want to see unanimity on the\n\nMarch 20, 2024  Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nCommittee or something close to it, meaning no more than one dissent, before you begin cutting rates?  Thank you. CHAIR POWELL.  We\u2019re a very consensus -oriented organization , and we do try to achieve consensus and , ideally , unanimity .  People do dissent .  It\u2019s something that happens.   Life goes on , and it \u2019s not a problem.  We\u2019ve always had dissent s.  But\u2014and so I \u2014you know, you respect thoughtful dissents very much.   It\u2019s like, you may not agree with some arguments, but you really want to understand them .  So you may read a book that takes a position that you have long opposed , just to understand [the position of] that book.  So I treat dissents with real respect as well. MICHELLE SMITH. Simon. SIMON RABINOVITCH.  Simon Rabinovitch with the Economist.   Can you hear me? CHAIR POWELL.  Yes. SIMON RABINOVITCH.  Okay .  Great.  Obviously , inflation is some ways away from target .  Unemployment , though, if you look at the projection for the full year of 4.0 percent, in February , we were already at 3.9 percent, so quite close to the median projection.  Are you concerned at all that \u2014notwithstanding the very strong jobs growth \u2014that in fact there may be some cracks appearing in the employment market?  You talked about a significant deterioration in the labor market being a condition for easing rates.   What would constitute that in your books? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. So we , of course , monitor \u2014it\u2019s one of our two goal variables .  We all monitor the labor market very, very carefully.  And I don \u2019t see those cracks today.   And I, you know \u2014we follow all the possible stories that are out there about , about there  being cracks , but the overall picture really is a strong labor market .  The extreme imbalances that we saw in the\n\nMarch 20, 2024  Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nearly parts of the pandemic recovery have mostly been resolved.  You\u2019re seeing high job growth . You\u2019re seeing big increases in supply .  You\u2019re seeing strong wage growth , but wage growth is gradually moderating down to more sustainable levels .  In many, many respects , the things are returning more to their state in 2019, which we can think of as normal for this purpose .  That\u2019s job openings and quits .  And surveys of workers and businesses are always interesting on this : You know, h ow tight is the \u2014how easy is it to find a job ?  How hard is it \u2014how easy it is to find a worker ?  Those have both \u2014those surveys have both come down. So the labor market is \u2014it\u2019s in good shape .  You know, y ou do see things like the low \u2014 the low  hiring rate , and people have made the argument that if , if layoffs were to increase, that would \u2014that would  mean that the net would be fairly quick increases in unemployment.  So that\u2019s something we \u2019re watching, but we \u2019re not seeing it.  Of course , initial claims are very, very low and, if anything, have tracked down a little bit.   So\u2014watching it carefully .  Don\u2019t see it. And when I say something \u2014I, I use the term \u201cunexpected \u201d weakening of the labor market.  So, you know,  we do expect the unemployment rate to \u2014the forecast is that it would move up, I think , closer to what we see as the longer -run sustainable level .  That\u2019s just\u2014that\u2019s just people \u2019s forecast, individual forecasts.   But we \u2019re talking about something that \u2019s unexpected.  That\u2019s where I \u2019ll leave it , though. MICHELLE SMITH.  Steve. STEVE MATTHEWS.  Steve Matthews with Bloomberg.  You mentioned at the beginning of the press conference that the Committee thought it might be appropriate to slow the pace of asset runoff fairly soon.  I\u2019m wondering is \u2014when you say fairly soon, does that mean that the Committee would meet about this again in May and a decision could be reached that soon?  And I was wondering if you could also just describe the scope of what the Committee is\n\nMarch 20, 2024  Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\ndiscussing here.  You\u2019re at $95 billion of caps right now .  Would that be cut about in half or something in that nature?  Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. So that is what we \u2019re discussing essentially is \u2014and we \u2019re not discussing all the other many other balance sheet issues.  We will discuss those in due course . But what we \u2019re really looking at is slowing the pace of runoff.  There isn't much runoff among MBS\u2014in MBS right now , but there is in Treasuries .  And w e\u2019re talking about going to a lower pace.   I don \u2019t want to give you a specific number because we haven \u2019t made a \u2014haven \u2019t had an agreement or decision, but that \u2019s the idea.  And that \u2019s what we \u2019re looking at. In terms of the timing, I said fairly soon.  I wouldn \u2019t want to try to be more specific than that, but you get the idea.  The idea is \u2014and this is in our longer -run plans \u2014that we may actually be able to get to a lower level, because we would avoid the kind of frictions that can happen. Liquidity is not evenly distributed in a system .  And there can be times when , in the aggregate, reserves are ample or even abundant , but not in every part .  And those parts where they \u2019re not ample, there can be stress , and that can cause you to prematurely stop the process to avoid the stress .  And then it would be very hard to restart , we think .  So something like that happened in \u201919 perhaps .  So that \u2019s what we \u2019re doing .  We\u2019re looking at what would be a good time and what would be a good structure , and \u201cfairly soon \u201d is words that we use to mean fairly soon. STEVE MATTHEWS.   And will there be a discussion about returning to an all - Treasuries balance sheet at some point? CHAIR POWELL.  So that \u2014our, our longer -run goal is to return to a balance sheet that is mostly Treasuries.   I do expect that , once we \u2019re through this , we\u2019ll come back to the other issues about the composition and the maturity and revisit those issues, but it \u2019s, you know,  not\n\nMarch 20, 2024  Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nurgent right now.  We want to get this , this  decision made first and then we can, when the time is right, come back to the other issues. MICHELLE SMITH.   Victoria. VICTORIA GUIDA.   Hi, Victoria Guida with Politico.  Also on the balance sheet, you know, can you talk a little bit about how the outlook for the banking sector might impact your balance sheet plans?   Do you worry that , as deposits start to shrink , that we could see more turbulence? CHAIR POWELL.  You know, w e\u2019ll be watching carefully .  But one of the reasons we\u2019re slowing down \u2014we will soon enough, fairly soon I should say, slow down \u2014is that we want to avoid any , any  kind of that turbulence.  I wasn \u2019t think ing particularly about the banking - sector turbulence, but we \u2014and we had some indicators the last time.  This is our second time in doing this, and I think we \u2019re going to be paying a lot of attention to the things that started to happen and that foreshadowed what eventually happened at the end of that tightening cycle where we wound up in a short [-of-]reserves situation.  And w e don\u2019t want to do that again.  And I think now we have a better sense of what are the indicators.   It isn \u2019t\u2014it wasn \u2019t so much in the banking system as it was around, for example, where federal funds  are trading relative to the administered rates and where secured rates are relative to the administered rates.  Those sorts of things.  We will always be watching the banking system for similar signs , though. VICTORIA GUIDA.  Well, is it also because you \u2019re not sure exactly how the reserve supply will react once the overnight reverse repo facility drops near \u2014at zero? CHAIR POWELL.  Well , I think we broadly think that , once  [take -up at]  the overnight [reverse] repo [facility] stabilizes, either at zero or close to zero, that , as the balance sheet\n\nMarch 20, 2024  Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nshrinks , we should expect that reserves will decline pretty close to dollar -for-dollar with that. That\u2019s what we think. MICHELLE SMI TH.  Let\u2019s go to Jean. JEAN YUNG.  Hi Chair Powell .  Jean Yung with MNI Market News.   I wanted to ask also about the balance sheet.  Will you \u2014you said that starting the taper sooner could get you to a smaller balance sheet size.   Does that mean you don \u2019t have to make a decision on when to end QT at this point ?  And will you be setting up the process for deciding that sooner , or will you wait until we \u2019re close to the end? CHAIR POWELL.  So it\u2019s sort of ironic that , by going slower , you can get farther .  But that\u2019s the idea.  The idea is that , with a smoother transition, you won \u2019t\u2014you\u2019ll run much less risk of kind of liquidity problems , which can grow into shocks , and which can cause you to stop the process prematurely.   So that \u2019s\u2014in terms of how it ends, we \u2019re going to be monitoring carefully money market conditions and asking ourselves whether they \u2014what they \u2019re telling us about reserves.  Are they \u2014right now , we would characterize them as \u201cabundant, \u201d and what we \u2019re aiming for is \u201cample \u201d and, you know, which is a little bit less than abundant.   So there isn \u2019t a\u2014 you know, there \u2019s not a dollar amount or a percent of GDP or anything like that where we think we have a really pretty clear understanding of that.  We\u2019re going to be looking at what these \u2014 what \u2019s happening in money markets , in particular \u2014a bunch of different indicators, including the ones I mentioned, to tell us when we \u2019re getting close.  Then , though, you reach a point ultimately where you stop allowing the balance sheet to run  off and you \u2014but then, from that point, there \u2019s another period in which nonreserves \u2014nonreserve liabilities grow organically , like currency, and that also shrinks the reserves at a very slow pace.  So you have a , you know, a  slower pace of runoff, which we \u2019ll have fairly soon .  Then you have another time where you effectively hold the\n\nMarch 20, 2024  Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nbalance sheet constant and allow nonreserve liabilities to expand .  And then that ultimately brings you, ideally, in for \u2014brings it into a nice, easy landing at a level that is above \u2014you know, above what we think the lowest possible ample number would be.  We\u2019re not trying for that .  We want to have a cushion, a b uffer , because we know that demand for reserves can be very volatile . And we don \u2019t want to, again , find ourselves in a situation where there aren \u2019t reserves , and w e have to turn around and buy assets and put reserves back in the banking system the way we did in 2019 and  \u201920. MICHELLE SMITH:  Nancy. NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  Hi, Nancy Marshall -Genzer with Marketplace.  Chair Powell, you said you \u2019re waiting to become more confident that inflation \u2019s getting to your 2 percent goal before you cut rates.   Can you just sum up more specifically what data you \u2019re looking at that would give you that confidence? CHAIR POWELL.   Sure.  So we \u2019re\u2014most importantly , we\u2019re looking at the incoming inflation data and the contents of it and what they \u2019re telling us , so that \u2019ll be\u2014and also the various components \u2014so obviously that \u2019s what we want .  We want more confidence that inflation is coming down sustainably toward 2 percent.  And, I mean , of course we \u2019ll also be looking at all the other things that are happening in the economy .  We\u2019ll look at the totality of the data, including everything essentially as we make that assessment .  But the most important thing will be the inflation data coming in. NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  Well, are there things that you would give more weight to , like wages? CHAIR POWELL.  Wages is one thing.   We don \u2019t\u2014our target is not wages .  It\u2019s really inflation.  But we would look to the fact that wages are still coming in very strong .  But, but\n\nMarch 20, 2024  Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nthey\u2019ve been \u2014wage increases , that\u2019s to say \u2014wage increases have been quite strong, but they \u2019re, they\u2019re  gradually coming down to levels that are more sustainable over time.  And that \u2019s what we want.  We don \u2019t think that \u2014the inflation was not originally caused \u2014we think, I don \u2019t think, by mostly by wages.   That wasn \u2019t really the story.  But we do think that , to get inflation back down to  2 percent sustainably, we \u2019d like to see , you know,  continuing gradual movement of wage increases at still high levels but back down to levels that are more sustainable over time. MICHELLE SMITH.  Let\u2019s go to Greg. GREG ROBB.  Thank you .  Greg Robb from MarketWatch.   Chair Powell, could you say at this meeting whether there were more officials who want ed to be careful and go slower than \u2014 about rates \u2014than there were at the last meeting?   Was there \u2014was there  that sense of maybe it \u2019s smart to wait?  Thanks. CHAIR POWELL.  I guess I \u2019d put it this way :  The\u2014if you look at the incoming inflation data that we \u2019ve had for January and February, I think very broadly that suggests that we were  right to wait until we \u2019re more confident.  So I think , I think \u2014I didn \u2019t hear anyone dismissing it as not information that we should look at or anything like that.   So I think , generally speaking , it does go in the direction of saying , yes, it \u2019s appropriate for us to be careful as we approach this question. MICHELLE SMITH.  Brendan. BRENDAN PEDERSEN.  Thanks Chair Powell.  Brendan Pedersen with Punchbowl News.   I wanted to ask you about central bank digital currency stuff.  We\u2019ve been hearing a lot from Republicans in Congress about what the Fed is or isn \u2019t doing in a digital dollar, but I know you have said to Congress that you \u2019re going to wait for approval before the Fed does anything \u2014 launches anything .  But folks like House Majority Whip Tom Emmer have said that the Fed is\n\nMarch 20, 2024  Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\neither actively researching or hiring personnel to study the implications of the CBDC.   Can you give us any clarity on what the Fed is doing right now on a digital dollar? CHAIR POWELL.  Sure.   So I think we \u2019ve been pretty transparent on this, but I will \u2014 I\u2019ll try harder.  So we are not getting ready to \u2014we haven \u2019t proposed \u2014we haven \u2019t come to a conclusion that we should propose , or anything like that, that Congress consider legislation to authorize a digital dollar.   And it would take legislation by Congress signed by the President to give us the ability to do what we think of as a CBDC, which is really a retail CBDC with the public.   So we \u2019re just a long, long way from that.  What we are doing , and I think what every major central bank is doing, is we \u2019re trying to stay in the frontiers of what \u2019s going on in digital finance , and it has many, many different areas .  It has applications in wholesale finance, in the payment system, and so we need \u2014to serve the public \u2014these issues have become very front burner in the last five or six years \u2014we need to be knowledgeable about all that.   So we actually do have people trying to understand things that are \u2014but it \u2019s wrong to say that we \u2019re working on a CBDC and that we \u2019ve secretly got a lab here where we\u2019ve got one , and we \u2019re just going to spring it on Congress at the right moment.  We don \u2019t.  I haven \u2019t at all , in my own mind , made a decision that I think this is something the U.S. should be doing.   I just think it \u2019s something we need to be \u2014we need to understand.  We do have people who are keeping up with that, as part of the broader payments landscape.  That\u2019s, that\u2019s  how I would characterize it. MICHELLE SMITH.  Mark. MARK HAMRICK.  Thank you.  It\u2019s Mark Hamrick with Bankrate.   Mr. Chairman, April  27 will mark the 13th anniversary since a Fed Chairman began holding regular news conferences.   How important is that higher transparency been in your view, both for the proper\n\nMarch 20, 2024  Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nfunctioning of the central bank and also in accomplishing your mission ?  And is there more that you and your colleagues can do on the transparency front ?  And what might that look like? CHAIR POWELL.  I generally think \u2014I mean , this movement actually started 30 years ago\u201430 years ago, when some academics posited that a more transparent central bank, if the public understands your reaction function, the markets will do your work for you .  They\u2019ll react to the data.  And so it all happens that way and so there \u2019s been a march toward greater and greater transparency.  And that \u2014certainly Chairman Bernanke advanced that, Chairman Greenspan did, Chair Yellen did, and I .  You know, s o we went from four press conferences a year to eight, so now every meeting really is \u201clive\u201d now.   I think that \u2019s a good innovation .  I wouldn \u2019t want to turn it back. We also have done a bunch of other things .  You know, w e have an annual supervision report, Financial Stability R eport .  I mean , there \u2019s a long list of things that we \u2019ve done.  I think you\u2014I mean , nothing comes to mind as really desperately  in need of doing  at this moment . We\u2019re very transparent .  We have no shortage of FOMC participants speaking to the public through the media.   And so that channel is full , I would say.  So I think it \u2019s generally broadly helped and made things better .  But not every day and in every way. MARK HAMRICK.  Well , to follow up :  Has there ever been a day where you wanted to put that genie back in the bottle somewhat? CHAIR POWELL.  Of course not.   [Laughter] MICHELLE SMITH.   Let\u2019s go to Jennifer , for the last question. JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.  Thank you , Chair Powell.  Jennifer Schonberger with Yahoo Finance.   Not to harp too much more on confidence and inflation , but you did say earlier in this press conference that the recent inflation data hasn \u2019t raised anyone \u2019s confidence.  But\n\nMarch 20, 2024  Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nwhen you testified before the Senate a couple weeks ago, you told lawmakers that you are \u201cnot far from receiving the confidence needed on inflation to begin cutting rates. \u201d  So are you still of that belief or not?  What are we to take by those words, \u201cnot far? \u201d CHAIR POWELL.  So let me say my main message at that \u2014in those two days of hearings was really that the Committee needs to see more evidence to build our confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our 2 percent goal , and we don \u2019t expect that it will be appropriate to begin to reduce rates until we \u2019re more confident  that that is the case.  I said that any number of times , so those were kind of the main part of the message.   We repeated that today in our statement.   I also \u2014to the language you mentioned, I , I really pointed out that we had made significant progress over the past year, and what we \u2019re looking for now is confirmation that that progress will continue.   We had a series of inflation readings over the second half of last year that were really much lower .  We didn \u2019t overreact , as I mentioned .  But that \u2019s what I had in mind. JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.  But given that you said that PCE for February, 2.8 percent the estimate , and that we have been seeing PCE \u2014core PCE coming down by a tenth of a percent every month, I mean , wouldn \u2019t you be at about 2.4 percent this summer, June , July, to a point where you could cut then? CHAIR POWELL.  Well, we \u2019ll just have to see how the data come in.  We would , of course , love to get great inflation data.  We got really good inflation data on the second \u2014in the second part of last year .  Again, we didn \u2019t overreact to it .  We said we needed to see more , and we said it would be bumpy .  And now we have January and February, which I \u2019ve talked about a couple of times.  So, you know,  we\u2019re looking for more good data , and we would certainly welcome it.   Thank you."

    "text": "May 1, 2024 Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nTranscript of Chair Powell\u2019s  Press Conference May 1, 2024\n\nCHAIR POWELL.  Good afternoon.  My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. The economy has made considerable progress toward our dual -mandate objectives.  Inflation has eased substantially over the past year , while the labor market has remained strong .  And that\u2019s very good news.  But inflation is still too high, further progress in bringing it down is not assured, and the path forward is uncertain.  We are fully committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent goal.  Restoring price stability is essential to achi eve a sustainably strong labor market that benefits all. Today , the FOMC decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings, though at a slower pace.  Our restrictive stance of monetary policy has been putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation, and the risks  to achieving our employment and inflation goals have moved toward better balance over the past year.  However, in recent months , inflation has shown a lack of further progress toward our 2 percent objective, and we remain highly attentive to inflation risks.  I\u2019 ll have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments. Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. Although GDP growth moderated from 3.4 percent in the fourth quarter of last year to 1.6 percent in the first quarter, private domestic f inal purchases\u2014which excludes inventory investment, government spending and net exports , and usually sends a clearer signal on underlying demand\u2014was 3.1 percent in the first quarter, as strong as the second half of 2023.  Consumer spending has been robust over the past several quarte rs, even as high interest rates\n\nMay 1, 2024 Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nhave weighed on housing and equipment investment.  Improving supply conditions have supported resilient demand and the strong performance of the U.S. economy over the past year. The labor market remains relatively tight, but supply  and demand conditions have come into better balance.  Payroll job gains averaged 276,000 jobs per month in the first quarter, while the unemployment rate remains low at 3.8 percent.  Strong job creation over the past year has been accompanied by an increase in the supply of workers, reflecting increases in participation among individuals aged 25 to 54 years and a continued strong pace of immigration.  Nominal wage growth has eased over the past year and the jobs- to-workers gap has narrowed, but labor demand still exceeds the supply of available workers. Inflation has eased notably over the past year but remains above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.  T otal PCE prices rose 2.7 percent over the 12 months ending in March; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent.   The inflation data received so far this year have been higher than expected.  Although s ome measures of short -term inflation expectations have increased in recent months, longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets. The Fed\u2019s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.  My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship , as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.  We are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective. The Committee decided at today\u2019s meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5\u00bc to 5\u00bd percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities\n\nMay 1, 2024 Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nholdings, though at a slower pace.  Over the past year, as labor market tightness has eased and inflation has declined, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals have moved toward better balance.  The economic outlook is uncertain, however, and we remain highly attentive to inflation risks. We\u2019ve stated that we do not expect  that it will be appropriate to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate until we have gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.  So far this year, the data have not given us that greater confidence.  In particular, and as I noted earlier, readings on inflation have come in above expectations.  It is likely that gaining such greater confidence will take longer than previously expected.  We are prepared to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for as long as appropriate.  We\u2019re also prepared to respond to an unexpected weakening in the labor market. We know that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could result in a reversal of the progress we \u2019ve seen on inflation.  At the same time, reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment.  In considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully ass ess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.  Policy is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that we face in  pursuing both sides of our dual mandate.  We will continue to make decisions meeting by meeting. Turning to our balance sheet :  The Committee decided at today\u2019s meeting to slow the pace of decline in our securities holdings, consistent with the plans we released previously.  Specifically, the cap on Treasury redemptions will be lowered from the current $60  billion per month to $25 billion per month as of June 1.  Consistent with the Committee\u2019s intention to hold primarily Treasury securities in the longer run, we \u2019re leaving the cap on agency securities\n\nMay 1, 2024 Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nunchanged per month, and  we will reinvest any proceeds in excess of this cap in Treasury securities.  With principal payments on agency securities currently running at about $15 billion per month, total portfolio runoff will amount to roughly $40 billion per month.  The decision to slow the pace of runoff does not mean that our balance sheet will ultimately shrink by less than it would otherwise but rather allows us to approach its ultimate level more gradually.  In particular, slowing the pace of runoff wi ll help ensure a smooth transition, reducing the possibility that money markets experience stress and thereby facilitating the ongoing decline in our securities holdings that are consistent with reaching the appropriate level of ample reserves. We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keeping longer -term inflation expectations well anchored.  Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run. To conclude :  We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country.  Everything we do is in service to our public mission.  We , at the Fed, will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals. Thank you.  I look forward to your questions. MICHELLE SMITH.  Howard. HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Thank you.  Howard Schneider with Reuters.  A question and follow -up if I could, do you consider the current policy rate still \u2014are you confident that it \u2019s sufficiently restrictive to get inflation back to 2 percent? CHAIR POWELL.  So I do think the evidence shows , you know, pretty clearly that policy is restrictive and is weighing on demand, and there are a few places I would point to for that.  You can start with the labor market .  So demand is still strong\u2014the demand side of the labor market , in particular\u2014but it \u2019s cooled from its extremely high level of a couple years ago,\n\nMay 1, 2024 Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nand you see that in job openings .  You saw it \u2014more evidence of that today in the JOLTS report , as you\u2019 ll know.  It\u2019 s still higher than pre -pandemic .  But it has been coming down both in the Indeed r eport and the JOLTS  report .  That\u2019s, that\u2019s  demand cooling.  The same is true of quits and hiring rates, which have essentially normalized.  I also look at the \u2014we look at surveys of workers and \u2014pardon me \u2014surveys of workers and businesses , and [they] ask workers , \u201cAre jobs plentiful? \u201d and ask businesses, \u201c Are workers plentiful?   Is it easy to find workers ?\u201d  And you\u2019 ve seen that the answers to those have come back down to pre -pandemic levels.  You also see in interest -sensitive spending, like housing and investment \u2014you also see that higher  interest rates are weighing on those activities.  So I do think it \u2019s clear that , that  policy is restrictive. HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Sufficiently restrictive, I guess. CHAIR POWELL.  So I would say that we believe it is restrictive , and we believe  [that] over time it will be sufficiently restrictive.  That will be a question that, that  the data will have to answer. HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  So as a follow -up, if inflation continues running roughly sideways as it has been, the job market stays reasonably strong, unemployment low, and expectations are anchored and maintained, would you disrupt that for \u2014 CHAIR POWELL.  Expectations are not anchored? HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Are anchored. CHAIR POWELL.  Are anchored. HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Stable, roughly .  Would you disrupt that for the last half point on PCE?\n\nMay 1, 2024 Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nCHAIR POWELL.  You know, I don\u2019 t want to get into complicated hypotheticals .  But I would say that , you know, we \u2019re committed to retaining our current restrictive stance of policy for as long as is appropriate .  And w e\u2019ll do that. MICHELLE SMITH.  Jeanna . JEANNA SMIALEK.  Thanks for taking our questions , Chair Powell.  I wonder \u2014you know, obviously Michelle Bowman has been saying that there is a risk that rates may need to increase further, although it \u2019s not her baseline outlook.  I wonder if you see that as a risk as well, and, if so, what change in conditions would merit considering raising rates at this point? CHAIR POWELL.  So I think it \u2019s unlikely that the next policy rate move will be a hike. I\u2019d say it \u2019s unlikely.  You know, our policy focus is really what I just mentioned, which is \u2014 which is  how long to keep policy restrictive.  You ask , what would it take ?  You know, I think we\u2019d need to see persuasive evidence that our policy stance is not sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation sustainably down to 2 percent over time.  That\u2019s not \u2014that\u2019s not  what we think we \u2019re seeing, as I \u2014as I  mentioned, but that\u2019s \u2014something like that is what it would take.  We\u2019d look at the totality of the data in  answer  to that question .  That would include inflation, inflation expectations, and all the other data too. JEANNA SMIALEK.  Would that be \u2014would that be  a reacceleration in inflation? CHAIR POWELL.  Well, I think , again, the test \u2014what I \u2019m saying is , if we were to come to that conclusion that policy weren\u2019 t tight enough to achieve that , so it would be the totality of all the things we \u2019d be looking at.  It could be expectations .  It could be a combination of things . But, if we \u2014if we reach that conclusion\u2014and we don\u2019 t see evidence supporting that conclusion \u2014that \u2019s what it would take I think for us to take that step. MICHELLE SMITH.   Chris.\n\nMay 1, 2024 Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nCHRIS TOPHER RUGABER.  Thank you, Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.  You didn\u2019 t mention the idea that rates are at a peak for the cycle and didn \u2019t mention the idea that it might be appropriate to cut rates later this year as you have in previous press conferences.  So has the F ed sort of dropped its easing bias?  Where are you standing on that? CHAIR POWELL.  So, on \u2014let me address cuts.  So, obviously , our decisions that we make on our policy rate are going to depend on the incoming data, how the outlook is evolving, and the balance of risks, as always.  And we \u2019ll look at the totality of the data.  So I think, and we think, that policy is well  positioned to address different paths that the economy might take.  And we\u2019ve said that we don\u2019 t think it would be appropriate to dial back our restrictive policy stance until we \u2019ve gained greater confidence  that inflation is moving down sustainably toward 2 percent.  So, for example, let me take a path :  If we did have a path where inflation proves more persistent than expected and where the labor market remains strong , but inflation is moving sideways and we\u2019 re not gaining greater confidence, well, that would be a case in which it could be appropriate to hold off on rate cuts. I think there \u2019s also other paths that the economy could take , which , which would cause us to want to consider rate cuts .  And those would be \u2014two of those paths would be that we do gain greater confidence, as we \u2019ve said, that inflation is moving sustainably down to 2 percent , and another path could be , you know, an unexpected weakening in the labor market, for example.  So those are paths in which you could see us cutting rates.  So I think it really will depend on the data.  In terms of peak rate, you know, I think , really , it\u2019s the same question .  I, I think the dat a will have to answer that question for us.\n\nMay 1, 2024 Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nCHRIS TOPHER RUGABER.  And could you just follow \u2014on the path where you might not cut, is that \u2014you mentioned that would be inflation persistent \u2014I mean, is inflation \u2014would that be the key data in making that decision, or could you expand a bit more on that?   Thank you. CHAIR POWELL.  Again, it \u2019s, it\u2019s\u2014we \u2019ve set ourselves a test that we \u2014for us to begin to reduce policy restriction, we \u2019d want to be confident that inflation is moving\u2014you know, moving sustainably down to 2 percent, and, for sure , one of the things we \u2019d be looking at is the performance of inflation.  We\u2019d also be looking at inflation expectations .  We\u2019d be looking at the whole story .  But clearly, incoming , incoming inflation data would be at the very heart of that decision. CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.  Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH.  Nick. NICK TIMIRAOS.  Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.  Chair Powell, to what extent has the easing in financial conditions since November contributed to the reacceleration in growth, and do you now expect a period of sustained tighter financial conditions will be needed to resume the sort of disinflation the e conomy saw last year? CHAIR POWELL.  So I think it \u2019s hard to know that.  I think we \u2019ll be able to look back, you know, from down the road and look back and understand it better.  You know, i f you look at\u2014let \u2019s look at growth.  R eally , what we \u2019ve seen so far this year in the first quarter is growth coming in about consistent with where it was last year.  I know GDP came in lower , but you don\u2019t see an acceleration in growth .  I mean , the thought would be that financial conditions loosened in, in, December , and that caused an uptic k in activity , and that caused inflation. Presumably , that\u2019s what we \u2019re tightening in the labor market.  You don\u2019 t really see that happening.  What you see is economic activity at a level that \u2019s roughly the same as , as last year.\n\nMay 1, 2024 Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nSo, you know, what \u2019s causing this inflation ?  You know, we \u2019ll, we\u2019ll  have a better sense of that over time .  I don\u2019 t know that there \u2019s an obvious connection there , though, with easing of financial conditions.   In terms of tightening, you \u2019re, you\u2019re  right .  Rates are certainly higher now and have been for some time than they were before the December meeting .  And they\u2019 re higher , and that \u2019s tighter financial conditions .  And, you know, that \u2019s appropriate , given what inflation has done in the first quarter. NICK TIMIRAOS.  You\u2019ve said in the past that stronger growth wouldn\u2019 t necessarily preclude rate cuts.   I wonder , would continued strength in the labor market change your view about the appropriate stance of policy if it was accompanied by signs the wage growth was reaccelerating ? CHAIR POWELL.  So I just want to be careful that we don \u2019t target wage growth or the labor market .  And remember what we saw last year :  very strong growth, a really tight labor market, and a historically fast decline in inflation.   So\u2014and that \u2019s because we know there are two forces at work here .  There\u2019s the unwinding of the pandemic -related supply- side distortions and demand -side distortions, and there \u2019s also monetary policy, you know, restrictive monetary policy.  So I wouldn\u2019 t rule out that something lik e that can continue .  You know, I wouldn\u2019 t give up, at this point, on further things happening on the supply side either because , you know, we do see that companies still report that there are supply -side issues that they \u2019re facing .  And also , even when the supply- side issues are solved , it should take some time for that to affect economic activity and ultimately inflation.   So there are still those things.  So I don\u2019 t like to say that either strong\u2014either growth or , or a strong labor market , in and of itself , would automatically create problems on inflatio n, because , of course , it didn\u2019 t do that last year.\n\nMay 1, 2024 Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nYou ask about wages .  We also don \u2019t\u2014we don\u2019 t target wages.  We target price inflation. It is one of the inputs .  The point with wages is , of course , we, like everyone else, like to see high wages, but we also want to see them not eaten up by high inflation.  A nd that \u2019s really what we \u2019re trying to do,  is to cool the economy and work with what \u2019s happening on the supply side to bring\u2014to bring the economy back to 2 percent inflation.   Part of that will probably be having wage increases move down incrementally toward levels that are more sustainable. MICHELLE SMITH.  Rachel. RACHEL SIEGEL.  Hi , Chair Powell .  Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.  Thanks for taking our questions.  You talked about needing time to gain more confidence that inflation is sustainably moving back down to 2 percent .  It\u2019s May now .  Do you have time this year to cut three times, just given the calendar? CHAIR POWELL.  Yeah .  I\u2019m not really thinking of it that way.  You know, the \u2014what we said is that we need to be more confident , and we \u2019ve said \u2014my colleagues and I today said that we didn \u2019t see progress in the first \u2014in the first quarter .  And I\u2019ve said that it appears , then, that it\u2019 s going to take longer for us to reach that point of confidence .  So I don\u2019 t know how long it\u2019ll take .  You know, I can just say that when we get that confidence, then rate cuts will be in scope .  And I don\u2019 t know exactly when that will be. RACHEL SIEGEL.  And, with hindsight, are there any signs that you can look back on now, looking at the reports from January or February or March, that suggested something more worrying than just expected bumpiness? CHAIR POWELL.  I \u2014you know, not really .  You know, what , what \u2014so I thought it was appropriate to reserve judgment until , until  we had the full quarter \u2019s data, until we saw the March data.   And so take a step back .  What do we now see in the first quarter?  We see strong economic\n\nMay 1, 2024 Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL Page 11  of 26 activity, we see a strong labor market, and we see inflation.  We see three inflation readings , and so I think you\u2019 re at a point there where you should take some signal.  We don\u2019 t like to react to one or two months \u2019 data, but this is a full quarter .  And I think it \u2019s appropriate to take signal now, and we are taking signal.   And the signal that we \u2019re taking is that it \u2019s likely to take longer for us to gain confidence that we are on a sustainable path down to 2 percent inflation.  That\u2019s the signal that we \u2019re taking now .  Yeah. MICHELLE SMITH.   Steve. STEVE LIESMAN.  Mr. Chair, if I could \u2014Steve Liesman, CNBC.   If I could follow  up on that :  What particular areas were sort of temporary or blips in the inflation data in the first quarter?   What\u2019s the dynamic by which you expect them to work out in the coming months and quarters? CHAIR POWELL.  Yeah.  So we will \u2014you know, we will put the thing \u2014we have put the thing under a microscope.  I will say , nothing is going to come out of  that that \u2019s going to change the view .  I think that, in fact, we didn\u2019 t gain confidence and that it \u2019s going to take longer to get that confidence \u2014but\u2014confidence.   I just think \u2014you know the story .  What\u2019s happened since December is you\u2019 ve seen higher goods inflation than expected, and you\u2019 ve seen higher nonhousing services inflation than expected.  A nd those two are working together to, to  sort of be higher than we had thought.  And there are stories behind how that happened, and, you know, we\u2014I think \u2014I thin k my expectation is that we will, over the course of this year, see inflation move back down.  That\u2019s, that\u2019s  my forecast .  I think my confidence in that is lower than it was because of the data that we\u2019 ve seen.  So, you know, we \u2019re looking at th ose things .  We also continue to expect, and I continue to expect , that housing services inflation, given where market rents are, those will show up in measured housing services inflation over time.   We believe that it\n\nMay 1, 2024 Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nwill.  I t just \u2014it looks like the lag\u2014 that there are substantial lags between when , you know, lower market rates turned up and \u2014for new tenants and when it shows up for existing tenants or for in -housing services. STEVE LIESMAN.  If I could just follow  up:  Is there a bit of a contradiction in the idea that you are reducing quantitative tightening, which is sort of an easing, while you \u2019re holding rates steady at a restrictive rate to try to slow and cool the economy and inflation?   Thank you. CHAIR POWELL.  I wouldn\u2019 t say that .  No.  I mean , the active tool of monetary policy is, of course , the interest rates .  And this is \u2014this is a long\u2014a plan we \u2019ve long had in place to slow, really not in order to , you know, provide accommodation to the economy but to\u2014or to be less restrictive to the economy .  It really is to ensure that the process of shrinking the balance sheet down to where we want to get it is a smooth one and doesn\u2019 t wind up in \u2014wi th financial market turmoil the way it did the last \u2014the las t time we did this and the only other time we \u2019ve ever done this. MICHELLE SMITH.  Craig. CRAIG TORRES.  Craig Torres from Bloomberg.   Two questions .  First, a simple one . Given the run of data since March, has the probability in your mind of no cuts this year increased or stayed the same?  That\u2019s the first question.   Second question.  Chair Powell, you joined the Board in 2012, and I \u2019m sure you remember , as I do , what the jobless recovery was like :  lawyers, accountants, all kinds of highly qualified people who couldn\u2019 t get jobs.  And given your history there, I wonder if there \u2019s an argument for being more patient with inflation here.  We have strong productivity growth that \u2019s helping wages grow up\u2014go up.  W e have good employment .  And so it seems to me there \u2019s a lot of hysteria about inflation.  I agree \u2014you know, nobody likes it, but is\n\nMay 1, 2024 Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nthere an argument for being patient and working with the economic cycle to get it down over time?  Thank you. CHAIR POWELL.  So , on your first question, I don\u2019 t have a probability estimate for you. But all I can say is that , you know, we \u2019ve said that we didn\u2019 t think it would be appropriate to cut until we were more confident that inflation was moving sustainably down to 2 percent .  We didn\u2019 t get our confidence , in that  [it] didn\u2019 t increase in the first quarter .  And, in fact, what really happened was we came to the view that it will take longer to get that confidence.  And I think there are\u2014you know, I think it\u2019s \u2014the economy has been very hard for forecasters broadly to predict \u2014to predict  its path .  But there are paths to , to not cutting, and there are paths to cutting. It\u2019s really going to depend on the data. In terms of the employment mandate, to your point, if you go back a couple of years, our , our sort of framework document says that , when you look at the two mandate goals, and if one of them is further away from goal than the other, then you focus on that one.   It actually \u2014it\u2019s the time to get back there times  the, you know, times  how far it is from the goal.  And that was clearly inflation.  So our focus was very much on inflation.  As\u2014and this is what we referred to in the statement .  As inflation has com e down, now to below 3 percent on a \u2014on a 12- month basis, it \u2019s become \u2014we \u2019re now focusing [ on] the other goal .  The employment goal now comes back into focus.  And so we are focusing on it.  And, a nd that \u2019s how we think about that. MICHELLE SMITH.  Claire. CLAIRE JONES.  Claire Jones, Financial Times.   Thanks a lot for the opportunity to ask the questions.  Just to go back to the answer before the previous one, it seemed to suggest that you think the likeliest path of inflation is one that \u2019s going to allow you to have a situation where rates are lower at the end of the year than they are right now.  It\u2019d be good if you could just\n\nMay 1, 2024 Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nconfirm whether or not that \u2019s a correct reading.  And the Q1  GDP print has  led to some \u2014some to start mentioning the term \u201c stagflation \u201d with respect to the U.S. economy.  Do you or anyone else on the FOMC think this is now a risk?  Thank you. CHAIR POWELL.  Yeah .  I\u2019m not dealing really in likelihoods.   I think there are \u2014there are paths that the economy can take that would involve cuts and there are paths that wouldn\u2019 t. And I don\u2019 t have great confidence in which of those paths \u2014I think I would say my personal forecast is that we will begin to see further progress on inflation this year.  I don\u2019 t know that it will be enough, sufficient.  I don\u2019 t know that it won\u2019 t.  I think we \u2019re going to have to let the data lead us on that . In terms of your question\u2014your second question was stagflation.  I guess I would say I was around for stagflation, and it was , you know, 10 percent \u201410 percent unemployment .  It was high single -digits inflation .  Right now we have \u2014and very slow growth\u2014so right now we have 3 percent growth, which is , you know, pretty solid growth I would say, by any measure, and we have inflation running under 3 percent.  So I don\u2019 t\u2014I don\u2019t really understand where that \u2019s coming from.   And, in addition, I would say most forecasters, including our forecasting, was that last year \u2019s level of growth was very high\u20143.4 percent in , I guess, the fourth quarter , you know \u2014 and probably not going to be sustained and would come down.  But that would be \u2014that would be our forecast.  That wouldn\u2019 t be stagflation.  That would still be to a very healthy level of growth.  And, of course , with inflation, you know, our \u2014we will return inflation to 2 percent, and that won\u2019 t be\u2014so I don\u2019 t see the \u201cstag\u201d or the \u201cflation,\u201d  actually.  [Laughter] MICHELLE SMITH.  Michael McKee. MICHAEL MCKEE.  Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television.  The Vice Chair of the FOMC said recently that he\u2019 s willing to consider the idea that potential growth has\n\nMay 1, 2024 Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nmoved up.  A nd, of course , he\u2019s \u201cMr. Potential Growth /r*.\u201d  Do you share that view , and would that imply that maybe policy isn \u2019t tight enough? CHAIR POWELL.  So I think I would take that question this way:  We saw a year of very high productivity growth in 2023, and we saw a year of , I think , negative productivity growth in 2022.  S o I think it \u2019s hard to draw from the data .  I mean , the question is , will productivity run\u2014there are two questions .  One is:  Will productivity run persistently above its longer -run trend?   I don\u2019 t think we know that.  In terms of potential output, though, that \u2019s a separate question .  We\u2019ve had a \u2014what amounts to a , a significant increase in the potential output of the economy that \u2019s not about productivity .  It was about having more labor, frankly, both through\u2014in 2022, both through participation and also through immigration.  So we \u2019re very much\u2014like other forecasters and economists\u2014getting our arms around what that means for potential output this year and next year \u2014and last year for that matter , too.  So I think \u2014in that case, I think you really do have a significant increase in potential output, but you\u2019 ve also got \u2014so you\u2019ve got more supply .  But those people also come in, they work, they have jobs, they spend. So you\u2019 ve also got demand.  So  it\u2014there may be \u2014it may be that you get more supply than you get demand at the beginning, but , ultimately , it should be neither inflationary nor disinflationary over, over  a longer period. MICHAEL MCKEE.  You said earlier that , at this point , you\u2019 re not really considering rate increases.   If growth is higher , but you\u2019 re not considering rate increases, does that imply that you\u2019re more worried about causing the economy to slow too much than you are about inflation taking off again? CHAIR POWELL.  No .  I think we , we believe our policy stance is in a good place and is appropriate to the current situation.  We believe it \u2019s restrictive, and , you know, we \u2014our evidence\n\nMay 1, 2024 Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nfor that, I went over earlier .  You see it in the labor market .  You see it in inflation -sensitive spending, where demand has clearly come down a lot over the past few years.  And that \u2019s, that\u2019s more from monetary policy, whereas the supply side  of things that are happening are more on the supply side.  So that \u2019s how I would think about it. MICHELLE SMITH.  Edward. EDWARD LAWRENCE.   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Edward Lawrence from F ox Business.  So GDP growth is about 2  percent .  Inflation \u2014[Un] employment is about 4 percent .  It feels a lot like a steady state, and we have 3 percent inflation .  So if the data remains the same that you \u2019re seeing, and I know you said you don\u2019 t see a rate hike, but it stands to reason that you would need a rate hike to get from 3 to 2 percent inflation.  So was there any discussion about a rate hike in today\u2019 s meeting , and, you know, are you satisfied with 3  percent inflation for the rest of the year? CHAIR POWELL.   Well, of course we \u2019re not satisfied with 3  percent inflation.  \u201c Three percent \u201d can\u2019t be in a sentence with \u201c satisfied. \u201d  [Laughter]  So  we will return inflation to 2 percent over time but over time.   And we think our policy stance is , is appropriate to do that. So if we were to conclude that policy is not sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation sustainably down to 2 percent, then that would be what it would take for us to want to increase rates.  We don\u2019t see that .  We don\u2019 t see evidence for that.  So that \u2019s where we are. EDWARD LA WRENCE.  Was there discussion about a rate hike at all? CHAIR POWELL.  So the policy focus has been on\u2014has really been on what to do about , about  holding the current \u2014the current level of restriction.  That\u2019s really \u2014that\u2019s part of the policy .  That\u2019s where the policy discussion was in the meeting.\n\nMay 1, 2024 Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nEDWARD LAWRENCE.   I wanted to follow [ up] on the 3 percent .  Is there a time frame of persistent inflation that would trigger a rate hike? CHAIR POWELL.  There isn \u2019t any rule .  You can\u2019t  look to a rule .  You know, t hese are\u2014 these are going to be judgment calls.  You know, c learly restrictive monetary policy needs more time to do its job.  That, that  is pretty clear , based on what we \u2019re seeing .  How long that will take and how patient we should be is going to depend on the totality of the data, how the outlook evolves. MICHELLE SMITH.  Victoria. VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi.  Victoria Guid a with Politico.  You\u2019ve talked about your commitment to being apolitical and nonpartisan.  A nd I was just wondering, given that it \u2019s an election year, is the bar for rate changes higher close to an election ?  And, similarly, is there a significant economic difference between , you know, starting to cut in , say, September versus December? CHAIR POWELL.   So we \u2019re, we\u2019re  always going to do what we think the right thing for the economy is when we come to that consensus view that it \u2019s the right thing to do for the economy.  That\u2019s our record .  That\u2019s what we do.  We\u2019re not looking at anything else .  You know, it\u2019s hard enough to get the economics right here.  These are difficult things , and if , if we were to take on a whole , another , set of factors and use that as a new filter, it would reduce the likelihood we\u2019d actually get the economics right.  So that \u2019s how we think about it around here.  And, you know , we\u2019re at peace over it.  We know that we \u2019ll do what we think is the right thing, when we think it \u2019s the right thing .  And we \u2019ll all do that.  And that \u2019s, that\u2019s  how everybody around here thinks.  So I can \u2019t say it enough, that we just don\u2019 t\u2014we just don\u2019 t go down that road.  If you go down that road, where do you stop?  And, and so we \u2019re not on that road.  W e\u2019re on the road\n\nMay 1, 2024 Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nwhere we \u2019re serving all the American people and making our decisions based on the data and how those data affect the outlook and the balance of risks. VICTORIA GUIDA.  And then, is there a significant difference between , you know, whether you start in , say, September versus December ? CHAIR POWELL.  There \u2019s\u2014 VICTORIA GUIDA.  A n economic difference . CHAIR POWELL.  \u2014a significant difference between an institution that takes into account all sorts of political events and one that doesn\u2019 t.  That\u2019s where the significant difference is, and, you know, we\u2019re \u2014we just don\u2019 t do that.  I mean , you can go back and read the transcripts for every \u2014this is my fourth election, fourth presidential election here .  Read all the transcripts , and see if anybody mentions , in any way, the pending election.  It just isn \u2019t part of our thinking.  It\u2019 s not what we \u2019re hired to do.  If we start down that road, again, I don\u2019 t know how you stop.  So. MICHELLE SMITH.   Simon. SIMON RABINOVITCH.   Thank you, Chair Powell.   Question about the labor market \u2014 you\u2019ve mentioned a few times that the labor market is normalizing .  Certainly , today \u2019s JOLTS data suggested that things are kind of getting back to pre -pandemic levels.   One thing that hasn\u2019 t normalized is wage growth, which is still quite a bit stronger than before the pandemic.  I wonder if you can share your analysis of , of why that \u2019s happening.  Is it a lagging indicator, or is something else going on? CHAIR POWELL.   So I think if you go back to where wages peaked\u2014 wage increases peaked a couple , three years ago \u2014essentially all wage measures have come down substantially [when compared] to that.  But they are not , not down to where they were before the pandemic.\n\nMay 1, 2024 Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nThey \u2019re still roughly a percentage point higher.  And we \u2019ve seen pretty consistent progress but not uniformly .  And you\u2019 ll note the ECI reading from Tuesday was \u2014it was expected to be \u2014to have come down, and, essentially , it was flat year  over  year , you know, I think roughly .  So yeah, I mean , it\u2019s\u2014that part of it is bumpy .  And, again , we don\u2019 t target wage increases, but , you know, in the longer run, if you have \u2014if you have wage increases running higher than productivity would warrant, then, you know, there will be inflationary pressures.  Employers will raise prices over time if that \u2019s the case.  S o we \u2019ve seen progress.  I t has been inconsistent, but we have seen a substantial decline overall .  But we have a ways to go on that. MICHELLE SMITH .  Scott.  Nancy.  I\u2019m sorry. NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  Hey, Chair Powell.  Nancy Marshall -Genzer from Marketplace.  You mentioned consumers , and consumers are feeling the weight of interest rates right now.  Mortgage rates are up , as are rates for car loans, credit cards.  P eople looking to borrow are very discouraged.  T hat\u2019s reflected in their views on the economy.  What would you say to them? CHAIR POWELL.  Well, the thing that hurts everybody , and particularly people in the lower -income brackets, is inflation.   If you\u2019 re a person who\u2019 s living paycheck to paycheck, and suddenly all the things you buy\u2014the fundamentals of life \u2014go up in price, you, you are in trouble right away.  And so, with those people in mind, in particular, what we\u2019 re doing is , we\u2019re using our tools to bring down inflation.  It will take some time, but we will succeed .  And we will bring inflation back down to 2 percent , and t hen people won\u2019 t have to worry about it again. That\u2019s what we \u2019re doing, and we know that it \u2019s painful and inconvenient .  But the dividends will be paid and will be very large .  And, and everyone will share in those dividends , and we \u2019ve made quite a lot of progress if you can think about it.  I think core\u2014I think headline \u2014core PCE\n\nMay 1, 2024 Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\n[inflation] peaked at 5.8 [percent].  N ow it \u2019s at\u2014anyway, headline peaked at 7.1.  N ow it \u2019s at 2.7. Don\u2019t want to get that wrong. NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.   No, you don\u2019 t.  Quick follow -up\u2014are current interest rates really doing that much , though,  to fight inflation right now for those consumers? CHAIR POWELL.  Yes.  I mean , I think\u2014I think that restrictive monetary policy is doing what it \u2019s supposed to do, and it\u2019s \u2014but it \u2019s also , in this case unusually , working alongside and with the healing of the supply side.  This, this \u2014what was different this time was that a big part of the source of the inflation and the reason why we \u2019re having this conversation is that we had this supply- side kind of collapse , with shortages and bottlenecks and all that kind of thing. And so\u2014and this was to do with the shutt ing down and reopening of the economy and other things that , that  really raised demand.  So, many factors did that.   So I think now you see those two things working together, the reversal of those supply and  demand distortions from the pandemic and the response to it, along with restrictive monetary policy .  Those two things are working to bring down inflation, and we \u2019ve made a lot of progress.   Let\u2019s remember how far we\u2019ve come.   And we have a ways to go.  W e\u2019ve got work left to do, but we \u2019re not looking at the very high inflation rates that we were seeing two years ago. MICHELLE SMITH.  Courtenay. COURTENAY BROWN.  Courtenay Brown from Axios.  Thanks for taking our questions, Chair Powell.  I wanted to follow  up on something you mentioned earlier on housing inflation .  There\u2019s kind of been this long- awaited  disinflation in  shelter that still hasn \u2019t arrived. So I guess two questions, how do you explain the substantial lags between some of the private - sector data we\u2019 re seeing and the government data, and how confident are you that rents will be helpful on the inflation front in the coming months?\n\nMay 1, 2024 Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nCHAIR POWELL.   So, essentially , there are\u2014there are a number of places in the economy where there are just lag structures built into the inflation process , and housing is one of them.  So when you have \u2014when , when someone goes to \u2014a new person goes to rent an apartment, that \u2019s called market rent , and you can see market rents are barely going up at all.  The inflation in those has been very low.  But it takes \u2014before that , they were incredibly high.  T hey sort of led the , the high part.  So what happens is , those market rents take years, actually , to get all the way into rents for tenants who are rolling over their leases.   Landlords don\u2019 t tend to charge as much of an increase to a rollover tenant , for whatever reason.  A nd what that does is it builds up a sort of  an unrealized portion of increases when there have been big increases .  And what happens is , you know \u2014it\u2019s complicated , but the story is it just takes some time for that to get in.  Now I am confident that, as long as market rents remain low, this is going to show up in measured inflation, assuming that market rents do remain low.  How\u2014 what will be the exact timing of it?  I think we \u2019ve learned that the lags are longer .  We now think significantly longer than we thought at the beginning, and so confident t hat it will come but not so confident in the timing of it.   But, yes, I expect that , that  this will happen. COURTENAY BROWN.  Thanks. MICHELLE SMITH.  Nick Jasinski . NICHOLAS JASINSKI.  Thank you, Chair Powell, for taking the questions.  This is Nicholas Jasinski from Barron\u2019 s Magazine.  It seems that over the past three or four years , economies and central banks in developed markets , at least , have been on more or less the same trajectory :  easing during the pandemic, fighting inflation with restrictive policy on the way out . It feels like that may be ending in 2024 based on some of the economic data from Europe and the U.S. and Japan and statements from those central banks as well.   So my question is, what , what\n\nMay 1, 2024 Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nconsiderations or risks does a period of more divergent global economic trajectories and central bank policies present for the FOMC? CHAIR POWELL.   So that \u2014you\u2019 re right .  I think that, that  may happen,  and, you know that we all serve domestic mandates, right?  So I think the difference between the United States and other countries that are now considering rate cuts is that they\u2019 re just not having the kind of growth we \u2019re having.  They have \u2014their inflation is performing about like ours or maybe a little better, but they\u2019 re not experiencing the kind of growth we \u2019re experiencing.  So we actually have the luxury of having strong growth and  a strong labor market, very low unemployment, high job creation, and all of that, and we can be patient .  And we will \u2014we \u2019ll be careful and cautious as we approach the decision to cut rates, w hereas I think other jurisdictions may go before that. In terms of the implications, you know, I think obviously markets see it coming.  I t\u2019s priced in now .  And so I think the markets and economies can adapt to i t.  And I think, you know, we haven \u2019t seen \u2014in addition , for the emerging market economies, we haven\u2019 t seen the kind of turmoil that was more frequent 20 years ago, 30 years ago.  A nd that \u2019s, I think, partly because emerging market countries, many of them have much better monetary policy frameworks, much more credibility on inflation .  And so they\u2019 re na vigating this pretty well this time. MICHELLE SMITH.  Jennifer. JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.  Thank you, Chair Powell.  Jennifer Schonberger with Yahoo Finance.  You sort of backed away from the notion that the economy would need to encounter pain for inflation to come back down.  But , given the sticky inflation data in the first quarter, can disinflation still happen along a relatively painless path for the economy , or is some softening in the labor market and the economy likely needed to bring inflation back down?\n\nMay 1, 2024 Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nCHAIR POWELL.  So you\u2019 re right .  I think we thought, and most people thought, there would have to be probably significant dislocations somewhere in the economy, perhaps the labor market, to get inflation all the way down from the very high levels it was at at the beginning of this episod e.  That didn\u2019 t happen.  T hat\u2019s a tremendous result .  We\u2019re very , of course , gratified and pleased that that hasn \u2019t happened.  And, if you look at the dynamics that enabled that, it really was that  this, the\u2014that so much of the gain was from the unwinding of things that weren \u2019t to do with monetary policy but  the unwinding of the distortions to the economy, you know, supply problems \u2014supply- side problems and also some , some  demand issues as well.  The unwinding of those really helped inflation come down.  Now, as I \u2019ve said, I \u2019m not giving up on that.  So I think \u2014I think it is possible that , that  those forces will still work to help us bring inflation down.  We can \u2019t\u2014we can\u2019t  be guaranteed that that \u2019s true , though.  And so we \u2019re\u2014you know, we\u2019re  trying to use our tools in a way that keeps the labor market strong, and the economy strong, but also helps bring inflation back down to 2 percent sustainably.  We will bring inflation down to 2 percent sustainably .  We hope we can do it without , you know, without  significant dislocations in the labor market or elsewhere. JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.   And speaking of dislocations in the labor market:  In terms of cutting , you said, if there were weakness in the job market , that could be a reason to cut rates.   So if the unemployment rate were to tick above 4 percent but inflation not back down to your 2 percent target, how would you look at that?   Would the unemployment rate popping back above 4 percent catch your attention? CHAIR POWELL.  You know, I said \u201c an unexpected weakening\u201d  is what I \u2014the way I characterize d it.  So , you know \u2014and I \u2019m not going to try to define exactly what I mean by that. But, you know , it would be \u2014it would have to be meaningful and get our attention and lead us to\n\nMay 1, 2024 Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nthink that the labor market was really significantly weakening for us to want to react to it.  A couple of tenths in the unemployment rate would be \u2014would probably not do that .  But a broader \u2014it would be a broader thing that would \u2014that would suggest that it would be appropriate to consider cutting.  I think whether you decide to cut will depend on all the facts and circumstances, not just that one. MICHELLE SMITH.  Kyle. KYLE CAMPBELL.  Chair Powell, thanks for taking the question.  Kyle Campbell with American Banker.   You\u2019ve said that broad and material changes are needed for the Basel  III Endgame proposal , and you\u2019 ve mentioned that  a re-proposal is something that \u2019s on the table.  As you\u2019ve had more time to sort of sit with the public commentary, process that, and understand the options available to you, do you have a better sense of whether a re- proposal will be necessary, and do you have a timeline in mind for when, you know, some sort of movement will be made on that front\u2014 either a re -proposal or a move to finalize? CHAIR POWELL.   So let me \u2014let me start by saying that the F ed is committed to , you know, completing this process and carrying out Basel III E ndgame in a way that \u2019s faithful to Basel and also comparable to what the other large comparable jurisdictions are doing.  We haven\u2019 t made any decisions on , on policy or on process at all .  Nothing.  Nothing.  N o decisions have been made.   I\u2019ll say again , though, if we conclude that re -proposal is appropriate, we won\u2019t hesitate to insist on that. KYLE CAMPBELL.  And then do you need to resolve issues  with the capital proposal in order to advance other parts of the regulatory agenda , or do you expect to continue to make progress on those other agenda items?  Thank you.\n\nMay 1, 2024 Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nCHAIR POWELL.  You know , there\u2019s no mechanical rule in place there.  B ut I would say that the , you know, the  Basel III process is by far the most important thing and really is , I think , occupying us at this time in terms of what\u2019 s, what\u2019s \u2014what we \u2019re moving ahead with. MICHELLE SMITH.   Let\u2019s go to Mark for the last question. MARK HAMRICK.  Thank you.  Mark Hamrick with Bankrate.  Mr. Chairman, what can you tell us about the approach that you take with your role in  the sense of trying to achieve consensus, which  you recently identified as a priority, while allowing for a range of views or even dissent ?  We don\u2019 t see many dissenting votes in the official statements, even when more spirited discussions are noted in the minutes after the fact.  How do you avoid groupthink and avoid a higher risk of a policy mistake?   Thank you. CHAIR POWELL.  So I think if you listen to, and you all do, listen to my 18 colleagues on the FOMC, you\u2019 ll see that we do not lack for a diversity of voices and perspectives.  We really don\u2019 t.  And it \u2019s one of the great aspects of the Federal Reserve System.  We have 12 R eserve Banks around the country where they have their own economic staff, not the people who work here at the Board.  T here are different people.  You know, and so each , each  Reserve Bank has its own culture around monetary policy and its own approach and that kind of thing.  It guarantees you a diversity of perspectives.  So I think that the  perspectives are very diverse. But\u2014and, in terms of \u2014in terms of dissents,  you know, we have dissents.  A nd, you know, a thoughtful dissent is a good thing, if someone really makes you think, that kind of thing.  But all I can say from my standpoint is I try \u2014I listen carefully to people .  I try to incorporate their thinking or do everything I can to incorporate their thinking into what we \u2019re doing .  And I think many people , if they feel that\u2019 s happening, you know, that  for most people most of the\n\nMay 1, 2024 Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\ntime, that\u2019 ll be enough.  A nd\u2014but I \u2019m not \u2014I mean , it\u2019s, it\u2019s not, you know, frowned upon or illegal or against the rules or anything like that.   It just is the way things come out . And I mean,  I think we have a very diverse group  of rounded people \u2014frankly , more diverse than it used to be in many dimensions, more diverse from the obvious gender and demographic ways, but also we have more people who are not Ph.D . economists .  So we have people from business and law and academia and things like that.  So I think we actually do have quite a good diverse perspective.  I think all of us read these stories about the lack of diversity , and we look around the room and say, \u201c I don\u2019 t understand.  I really don\u2019 t understand what they\u2019 re talking about.\u201d   So\u2014but I get the question, though.  Thank you very much."

My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on achieving our dual -mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of the American people.  Our economy has made considerable progress toward both goals over the past two years.  The labor market has come into better balance, with continued strong job gains and a low unemployment rate.  Inflation has eased substantially from a p eak of 7 percent to 2.7 percent but is still too high.  We are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2  percent goal in support of a strong economy that benefits everyone. Today, the FOMC decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings.  We are maintaining our restrictive stance of monetary policy in order to keep demand in line with supply and reduce inflationary pressures.  I \u2019ll have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments. Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. Although GDP growth moderated from 3.4 percent in the fourth quarter of last year to 1.3 percent in the first quarter, private domestic final purchases \u2014which excludes inventory investment, government spending, and net exports and usually sends a clearer signal on underlying demand\u2014grew at 2.8 percent in the first quarter, nearly as strong as the second half of 2023.  Growth of consumer spending has slowed from last ye ar\u2019s robust pace but remains solid.  And investment in equipment and intangibles has picked up from its anemic pace last year.  Improving supply conditions have supported resilient demand and the strong performance of the U.S. economy over the past year.  In our Summary of Economic Projections, Committee participants generally expect GDP growth to slow from last year\u2019 s pace, with a median projection of 2.1 percent this year and 2.0 percent over the next two years.\n\nJune 12, 2024   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nIn the labor market, supply and demand conditions have come into better balance. Payroll job gains averaged 218,000 jobs per month in April and May, a pace that is still strong but a bit below that seen in the first quarter.  The unemployment rate ticked up but remains low at 4 percent.  Strong job creation over the past couple of years has been accompanied by an increase in the supply of workers, reflecting increases in participation among individuals aged 25 to 54 years and a continued strong pace of imm igration.  Nominal wage growth has eased over the past year , and the jobs -to-workers gap has narrowed.  Overall, a broad set of indicators suggests that conditions in the labor market have returned to about where they stood on the eve of the pandemic \u2014relatively tight but not overheated.  FOMC participants expect la bor market strength to continue.  The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP is 4.0 percent at the end of this year and 4.2 percent at the end of next year. Inflation has eased notably over the past two years but remains above our longer -run goal of 2 percent.  Total PCE prices rose 2.7 percent over the 12 months ending in April; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 perce nt.  The c onsumer price index\u2014which came out this morning and tends to run higher than the PCE , PCE  price index\u2014 rose 3.3 percent over the 12 months ending in May, and the core CPI rose 3.4 percent.  The inflation data received earlier this year were higher than expected, though more recent monthly readings have eased somewhat.  Longer -term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households and businesses and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets.  The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 2.6  percent this year, 2.3 percent next year, and 2.0 percent in 2026. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship , as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials\n\nJune 12, 2024   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nlike food, housing, and transportation.  Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.  In support of these goals, the Committee decided at today\u2019 s meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5 \u00bc to 5\u00bd percent and to continue reducing our securities holdings.  As labor market tightness has eased and inflation has declined over the past year, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals ha ve moved toward better balance.  The economic outlook is uncertain, however, and we remain highly attentive to inflation risks. We\u2019ve stated that we do not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate until we have gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.  So far this year, the data have not given us that g reater confidence.  The most recent inflation readings have been more favorable than earlier in the year, however, and there has been modest further progress toward our inflation objective.  We will need to see more good data to bolster our confidence t hat inflation is moving sustainably toward 2  percent. We know that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could result in a reversal of the progress that we \u2019ve seen on inflation.  At the same time, reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment.  In considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully ass ess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. In our SEP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an appropriate path for the federal funds rate, based on what each participant judges to be the most likely scenario going forward.  If the economy evolves as expected, the median par ticipant projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 5.1 percent at the end of this year, 4.1 percent at the end of 2025, and 3.1 percent at the end of 2026.  But these projections are\n\nJune 12, 2024   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nnot a Committee plan or any kind of a decision.  As the economy evolves, assessments of the appropriate policy, policy path will adjust in order to best promote our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.  If the economy remains solid and inflation persists, we \u2019re prepared to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate as long as appropriate.  If the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or if inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated, we\u2019re prepared to respond.  Policy is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate.  We \u2019ll continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, based on the totality of the data and its implications for the outlook and the balance of risks. The Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy\u2014 maximum employment and stable prices.  We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keeping longer -term inflation expectations well anchored.  Restoring price stabi lity is essential to achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the long run.  Our success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans.  We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country.  Eve rything we do is in service to our public mission.  We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals. Thank you, and I look forward to your questions. MICHELLE SMITH.  Steve. STEVE LIESMAN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Steve Liesman, CNBC.  Just wondering if you could walk me through the Committee \u2019s average inflation forecast \u2014core PCE is now forecast to be 2.8 percent by the year -end.  It \u2019s already 2.75, and after today\u2019 s number, there were several forecasts on the street that it would be 2.6 at the end of this month.  Does that tell\n\nJune 12, 2024   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nyou that the average official expects no further progress in inflation a nd, in fact, that it \u2019s going to get worse?  And if you have this wrong, doesn\u2019 t it mean that you sort of \u2014you, you could have wrong the outlook for rates there? CHAIR POWELL.  Yeah.  So what \u2019s going on there is that we had very low readings in the second half of last year \u2014June through December, really.  And we \u2019re now lapping those.  So as you go through the 12 -month window, a very low reading drops out , and a new reading comes in.  The new reading gets added to the 12- month window.  So it\u2019s just a, a  slight element of conservativism that we \u2019re, we\u2019re  assuming a certain level of \u2014of, you know, incoming monthly PCE and core PCE numbers.  We \u2019re assuming, you know, good, but not great , numbers.  And if you put that on top of where we are now, you get a very slight increase in the 12- month \u2014in the 12-month, you know, reading.  Now, do we have high confidence that that \u2019s right?  No.  It\u2019 s just the kind of conservative way for forecasting things.  If we were to get more readings like today \u2019s reading, then, of course, that wouldn \u2019t be the case.  So it \u2019s just a forecasting device.  I think, I think\u2014let me say that we welcome today \u2019s reading and then hope for more like that. STEVE LIESMAN.  But if it comes in \u2014just to  follow  up\u2014if it comes in the way you forecast it, it would  seem strange for you to be cutting rates at all in context of a rising core PCE. Thank you. CHAIR POWELL.  Yeah \u2014no.  I mean, I think we\u2019ve, we\u2019ve\u2014what we said is that we don\u2019t think it\u2019 ll be appropriate to , to reduce rates and begin to loosen policy until we have more confidence that inflation is moving back down to 2 percent on a \u2014on a  sustainable basis.  And that\u2019s the\u2014that\u2019s the test we \u2019ve applied.  I don\u2019 t know that \u2014I think if we \u2014I don\u2019t know that this rules  that in or out.  I mean, really, it\u2019s, it\u2019s a forecast \u2014a fairly conservative forecast month by month that would lead to slightly higher, you know, 12- months rates by the end of the year.\n\nJune 12, 2024   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nIf we get, you know, good\u2014better readings  than that, then you will see that come down or , or remain the same.  If you \u2019re at 2.6, 2.7 [percent], you know, that \u2019s, that\u2019s  a really good place to be. MICHELLE SMITH.  Nick. NICK TIMIRAOS.  Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal .  Chair Powell, if I look at the, the rate projections, I see 15 of the 19 that are anticipating either one or two cut \u2014two cuts this year \u2014fairly evenly split between the two.  And so I wonder if you could explain a little more the nuances or the differences there.  Would two or three more inflation readings like the one that we saw this morning make a September interest rate cut possible? CHAIR POWELL.  So as far as the SEP part of that is concerned \u2014as you know, I talk to\u2014I talk to  all of the other participants on the FOMC every cycle , and we talk about their Summary of E conomic P rojections and, and the  dot plot \u2014and, you know, the ir dot plot and everything.  And what  you\u2014what  I hear and see is that people are looking at, at, you know, a range of plausible outcomes.   And in many cases, they \u2019re\u2014they\u2019re  thinking, \u201c I don\u2019 t really \u201d\u2014 you know, \u201c I can \u2019t really distinguish between two of these.  They \u2019re so close for me. \u201d  These are very close calls, but we ask them to write down the most likely one \u2014so they do.  And as, I think , you\u2019ve, you\u2019ve \u2014as you\u2019 ve said, there \u2019s 15 of the 19 are , are kind of clustered around one or two.  So I think I would look at , at all\u2014I\u2019d look at all  of them as plausible, but I \u2019d look at \u2014so I think that does tell you kind of what the Committee thinks. But what everyone agrees on is , it\u2019s going to be data dependent.  No one \u2014no one  brings to this or takes away from it that is on the Committee a really strong commitment to a particular rate path.  It\u2019 s actually just their forecast and  their\u2014it\u2019s a combination of their forecast and their own reaction function.  But, again, everyone would say that this is very data dependent, and I\n\nJune 12, 2024   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\ndon\u2019t hold it with high confidence.  And I think if you\u2019 re looking for \u2014and , and don\u2019 t really think that they \u2019re\u2014they\u2019re  not trying to send a strong signal that \u201c this is what I think is the right thing.\u201d   It\u2019s just what they think at a given moment in time , subject to data. In terms of, you know, future meetings, we haven\u2019 t, you know \u2014we don\u2019 t\u2014we don\u2019t  try to\u2014we don\u2019t  make decisions about future meetings until we get there.  I think in terms of what we need to see, I mentioned it earlier \u2014we, we want to \u2014we want to  gain further confidence. Certainly, more good inflation readings will help with that.  I \u2019m not going to be specific about how many because, you know, really, it \u2019s going to be not just the inflation rating \u2014readings \u2014it\u2019s going to be the totality of the data :  what \u2019s happening in the labor market, what \u2019s happening with the balance of risks, what \u2019s happening with the forecast, what \u2019s happening with growth.  You look at all of that, and you ask, \u201cA re we confident?  Have we reached an appropriate level of confi dence that inflation is moving down sustainably to  2 percent , or, alternatively, do we see really unexpected signs of weakness in the labor market that would call for a response ?\u201d\u2014which is\u2014which is another thing that could, could happen.  But, again, we don\u2019 t see that.  And I \u2014we do see today \u2019s\u2014we see today\u2019s report as, as  progress and as, you know, building confidence. But we , we don\u2019 t see ourselves as having the confidence that would warrant \u2014you know, that would warrant  beginning to, to loosen policy at this time. NICK TIMIRAOS.  And if I could quickly follow up\u2014did , did you or any of your colleagues change your interest rate projections after 8:30 or whenever you got the inflation numbers today? CHAIR POWELL.  So  we\u2014this happens too often, but it, it does happen.  It just is, you know \u2014data came\u2014 I think it happened a couple of meetings ago\u2014a few meetings ago.  So when that happens \u2014when there \u2019s an important data print during the meeting, first day or second day\u2014\n\nJune 12, 2024   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nwhat we do is , we, we make sure people remember that they have the ability to update.  We tell them how to do that.  And , and some people do;  some people don\u2019 t.  Most , most  people don\u2019 t. But I \u2019m not going to get into the specifics, but you have the ability to do that.  So that, you know \u2014what \u2019s in the SEP actually does reflect the data that we got today to the extent you can, you know, reflect it in one day.  I think we \u2019ll, you know \u2014you will see PPI tomorrow .  We\u2019ll know more about the PCE [inflation] readi ng as the month goes on.  But the initial CPI reading and its, you know, kind of first -level translation to , to PCE  [inflation] we did have this morning. We were briefed about it , and people were able to consider whether they should make changes. And, as I said, you know, some people generally do, but most people generally don\u2019 t. MICHELLE SMITH.  Jonnelle. JONNELLE MARTE.  Hi, Chair Powell.   Jonnelle Marte from Bloomberg.  As you noted, the labor market is now in many ways back to where it was before the pandemic.  I wondered if you could comment on how officials are viewing that .  So do you think that there still needs to be more cooling in the labor market to bring inflation all the way down to 2 percent , or is there any sense that maybe the labor market is more vulnerable now to higher rates now that many of those imbalances have eased? CHAIR POWELL.  Sure .  So by, by so many measures, the labor market was, was  kind of overheated two years ago.  And we \u2019ve seen it gradually move back into much better balance between supply and demand.  So, what have we seen?  We \u2019ve seen labor force supply come up quite a bit through immigration and through recovering participation.  That \u2019s ongoing, mostly now through the im migration channel.  But still, we \u2019ve had some increases in prime -age labor force.   In terms of on the demand side, you know, we \u2019ve seen \u2014well, we\u2019ve seen quits moving down.  W e\u2019ve seen job openings moving down.  W e\u2019ve seen wage increases moving from very,\n\nJune 12, 2024   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nvery high levels a couple of years ago back down to more sustainable levels.  We have seen unemployment creep up now sixth- tenths over the course of , of a year or so very, very gradually. So you put all that together \u2014what you have is still -low unemployment, still 4 percent unemployment \u2014historically low.  But it \u2019s moved up a little bit \u2014it\u2019s softened a bit \u2014and, and, you know, that \u2019s an important statistic.  But , but more than that, you\u2019 ve got strong job creation. You, you have payroll jobs still coming in strong, even though, you know, there \u2019s an argument that they may be a bit over stated but still they \u2019re, they\u2019re still\u2014they\u2019re  strong.  So that \u2019s what we see.  We, we  watch the labor market, of course, and the economy as a whole \u2014but the labor market very carefully \u2014and that \u2019s what we see.  We see gradual cooling \u2014gradual moving toward better balance.  We\u2019re monitoring it carefully for signs of, of  something more than that, but we really don\u2019 t see that. JONNELLE MARTE.  As a quick follow- up\u2014t he surveys that make up the jobs report are, are  showing different tales.  There \u2019s been some divergence, especially , we saw , in the last report that we got on Friday.  So how do you interpret that , and, and how does it change your view on the labor market? CHAIR POWELL.  So sometimes it\u2019s \u2014you can \u2019t reconcile the differences.  Y ou just have to, have to \u2014have to look at it and, and try to understand.  And that \u2019s why it always makes sense to look at a series, you know, in 6\u2014in  3, 6, and 12 months of things rather than just one report.   But you\u2019 re right to point to the last report, where it  was your \u2014job losses in the household survey\u2014job gains , big job gains in the establishment survey.  So, I mean, we \u2019re left with ambiguous results, and we have to deal with that uncertainty around data.  Nonetheless, the overall picture is one of a strong and gradually cooling\u2014gradually rebalancing labor market.  Job openings, while they \u2019ve come way down, are still, you know, greater than the number of\n\nJune 12, 2024   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nunemployed people.  The jobs \u2013workers gap is still a significantly positive number \u2014greater than it was before the pandemic.  So , overall, we \u2019re looking at what i s still a very strong labor market but not the superheated labor market of two years ago or even one year ago. MICHELLE SMITH.  Neil . NEIL IRWIN.  Thanks, Chair Powell.  Neil Irwin , with Axios.  Back on the rates path : The SEP showed quite a large shift of rate  cut expectations relative to March \u2014that \u2019s a period in which the economic data flow hasn\u2019 t been that dramatic a shift.  How, how \u2014can you provide some color on what change d in the attitudes on the Committee over the last three months to , to see a much shallower path of rate cuts this year? CHAIR POWELL.  Yeah.  The big thing that changed was the inflation forecast.  So  the inflation forecast moved up several tenths for the end of the year.  And , and, as I mentioned earlier , in the, you know \u2014what , what  did we take away from this?  We had really , really  good inflation data in the second half of last year, then kind of a pause in progress in the first quarter. And what we took away from that was that it \u2019s probably going to take longer to get the confidence that we need to begin to loosen policy .  So the sense of that is that rate cuts that might take place in \u2014might \u2019ve taken place this year \u2014take place next year, you know?   We, we\u2014t here are\u2014there are fewer rate cuts in the median this year, but there \u2019s one more next year.  So, so you really \u2014if you look at year -end 2025 and \u2019 26, you\u2019 re, you\u2019re  almost exactly where you would have been, just it \u2014just it\u2019 s moved later because of that progress.  Now, you get another \u2014you get data \u2014different data today.  So we \u2019ll have to see where the data light the way .  You know, we\u2019re, we\u2019re \u2014the economy has, you know, repeatedly surprised forecasters in both directions, and today was certainly a better inflation report than almost anybody expected.  And we \u2019ll just\n\nJune 12, 2024   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nhave to see what , what \u2014what  the incoming data flow brings and, and how that affects the outlook and the balance of risks. MICHELLE SMITH.  Jeanna. JEANNA SMIALEK.  Jeanna Smialek, New York Times.  Thanks for taking our questions.  In the S ummary of E conomic P rojections, the long- run interest rate forecast moved up a bit.  I wonder if we should read that as a sign that you think that policy is not sort of as restrictive as we \u2019ve previously expected.  You know, how should we interpret what that means about how the Committee views its current policy setting? CHAIR POWELL.  So two things about that \u2014one , one  is this \u2014you\u2019 re right, it did move up.  B ut, but I want to remember to point out that the long -run neutral rate of interest is , is a long- run concept.  It , it really is a theoretical concept \u2014can \u2019t be directly observed.  And what it is is the , the interest rate that would hold the economy at equilibrium\u2014 maximum employment and price stability \u2014potentially, potentially  years in the future where there are no shocks.  So it\u2019s\u2014 it\u2019s a little bit \u2014it\u2019s not something we observe today.  Today we \u2019ve got a very specific economy with all kinds of shocks we \u2019re still getting over from the pandemic.  So it\u2019s\u2014I, I don \u2019t think that the, the concept of r -star\u2014it\u2019s a very important concept in economics and in what we do.  B ut, honestly, it doesn\u2019 t really get you where you need to be to think about what appropriate policy is in the near term. But I, I \u2014back to your original question , people have been gradually writing it up because I just think people are coming to the view that rates are n\u2019t\u2014are less likely to go down to their , their pre-pandemic levels, which were , you know, very low by recent history measures.  Now, we, we can\u2019t really know that.  That \u2019s, that\u2019s  an interesting dispute and discussion to have now, but, ultimately, we think that things like the neutral rate are driven by longer -run, slow -moving\n\nJune 12, 2024   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nforces.  And, you know, there \u2019s a really good question about whether , whether  those really have changed or whether , instead, rates and the economy are experiencing a , a series of persistent but, ultimately, temporary shocks.  That \u2019s been the debate, and we can \u2019t know.  But in the meantime, we\u2019re making policy with the economy that we have \u2014with the distortions that we have.  And  I, I also\u2014to your other point, I , I think it is \u2014it is the case that as time has gone by, the question of \u201cHow restrictive is policy?\u201d has become one that everyone \u2019s asking, and we \u2019re asking it , too. And, you know, my answer has been that policy is restrictive.  The question of whether it \u2019s sufficiently restrictive is going to be one we , we know over time.  But I think for the reasons I \u2019ve talked about at the last press conference and , and  other places, I think the evidence is pretty clear that policy is restrictive and is having, you know, the effects that we would hope for. MICHELLE SMITH. Howard. HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Thanks, Chair Powell .  Howard Schneider , with Reuters.  Just to\u2014just to carry that a little further, should we read this as a conclusion that the combination of tipping to one cut this year and acknowledging further progress on inflation as kind of a mark to market on the level of restrictiveness that you need\u2014that you, in fact, have concluded that you weren \u2019t quite there yet? CHAIR POWELL.   I\u2019d be reluctant to try to draw that conclusion.  I , I think this is about, you know, looking at the incoming data and asking, \u201cH ow much progress are we making on inflation, and how is the rest of the economy doing?  I s the labor market still strong? \u201d  That \u2019s what we \u2019re thinking about .  You know, you can\u2014you can translate it into the \u2014into the language you\u2019re talking about , but, to me, the focus is more on, we have a goal, which is price stability, and an other goal, which is maximum employment.  How are we doing there?  We think we \u2019ve got a good, strong labor market still.  We think we \u2019ve been making progress toward the price -\n\nJune 12, 2024   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nstability goal.  And then for a while , there was a pause.  A nd we look at today\u2019 s thing, and we think, \u201cW ell, that \u2019s a good reading, and we hope we get more like that. \u201d  And, you know, in the meantime, we\u2019 re asking , \u201cIs our policy stance about right? \u201d  And I think we think, \u201cY es, it \u2019s about right.\u201d   We\u2019 re prepared to adjust that as appropriate, but we think\u2014 we think we \u2019re getting the things that we would want to get , broadly speaking.  And that \u2019s why we \u2019ve been at this policy r ate now for almost a year. HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  So, so just to follow up on that \u2014I think one , one  curious thing here is , you\u2019 ve got now this restrictive policy in place and virtually no change in any of the major things for all of this year.  You \u2019ve got growth that stays above long- run potential throughout the forecast period, unemployment that never goes above the long- run estimate \u2014 right ?\u2014of 4.2.  So this isn\u2019 t a story of slack improving inflation.   So where \u2019s the improvement in inflation coming from that it\u2019 s going to pick up pace so much in 2025? CHAIR POWELL.  Well, you know, it\u2019s been coming \u2014where\u2019s it been coming from \u2014 let\u2019s start with that.  You know, clearly a lot of what \u2014some of what we\u2019 ve been getting is just the reversal of the \u2014the unwinding of the pandemic -related distortions to both supply and demand.  And that is, you know \u2014that is complemented by and amplified \u2014supported by restrictive monetary policy.  So those two things have been working together.  We \u2019ve also had a very positive supply shock on the labor side. And, and, also, you get \u2014you  get a positive supply shock when the \u2014when the  supply conditions unwind and return to normal.  So  you\u2019 ve had, you know, above -trend potential growth and , and high growth.  And yet you\u2019 ve had the benefit of , of inflation coming down, you know, really fast, actually, last year, and you will see what the rest of this year brinks \u2014brings.  So these dynamics can continue as long as they continue.  I mean, ultimately, the question is , ultimately, are you down to demand?  And , and we don\u2019 t know that,\n\nJune 12, 2024   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nthough.  I mean, look at today\u2019 s report .  You know , if we see more like that \u2014you know, we don\u2019t \u2014we can \u2019t know what the future holds.  But in the meantime, we \u2019ve made pretty good progress on inflation with our current stance. MICHELLE SMITH.  Mike. MICHAEL MCKEE.  Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television.  The base case of the Committee seems to be that there is going to be at least one rate cut this year, but your growth forecast doesn\u2019 t see any slowdown in the rest of the year , nor does the unemployment forecast see any significant weakening of the labor market.  And your inflation forecasts basically average out to no change.  So if , at the end of the year , there is no change from conditions now, why would you anticipate cutting rates?  Wh at, what  would be the point for a rate cut? CHAIR POWELL.  Well, we think \u2014we think policy is restrictive.  And we think, ultimately, that if you\u2014if you just set policy at a restrictive level, eventually you will see real weakening in the economy.  So that \u2019s always been the thought is that, you know, since we raise rates this far, we\u2019 ve, we\u2019ve  always been pointing to cuts at a certain point.  Not to eliminate the possibility of hikes, but, you know, no one has that as their base case , so\u2014no one on the Committee does.  But so that \u2019s, that\u2019s \u2014you know, that \u2019s how we think about it.  And that \u2019s what we\u2019ve been getting.  That \u2019s what we \u2019ve been getting is good progress on inflation, with growth at a\u2014at a, a good level  and with a strong labor market.  Now, ultimately, we think rates will have to come down to continue to support that.  But, so far, they haven\u2019 t had to.  And, you know, that\u2019s why we \u2019re watching so carefully for signs of weakness.  We don\u2019 t really see that.  We kind of see what we wanted to see, which was gradual cooling in demand \u2014gradual rebalancing in the\n\nJune 12, 2024   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nlabor market while we \u2019re continuing to make progress on inflation.  So we \u2019re getting \u2014we\u2019re getting good results here. MICHAEL MCKEE.  But , to follow up :  Is there any kind of concern for the housing industry or financial stability \u2014banks \u2014in leaving rates where they are for too long at this point? CHAIR POWELL.  On housing\u2014you know, the housing situation is a complicated one. And you can see that \u2019s a place where rates are really having , having a significant effect.  I mean, ultimately, the best thing we can do for the housing market is to bring inflation down so that we can bring rates down so that the housing market can continue to normalize.  There will still be a national housing shortage , as there was before the pandemic. There will still be one, but the distortions that we see now with lock -ins and things like that \u2014you know, low mortgages \u2014in terms of banks, the banking system has been, you know, solid, strong, well capitalized.  Lending\u2014y ou know, we \u2019ve seen good performance by the banks.  We had the turmoil earlier last year , but, you know, banks have been focusing on bringing up their li quidity, bringing up their capital, and having a risk\u2014 risk-management plans in place.  So the banking system, you know, seems to be \u2014seems to be in good shape. MICHELLE SMITH.  Chris. CHRIS TOPHER RUGABER.  Thanks .  Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.  I was wondering if we can read\u2014on inflation, if you can tell us a little more about where you see inflationary pressure in the economy.  You mentioned labor markets coming into better balance, and inflation expectations appear to be well anchored.  You \u2019re seeing, you know, anecdotal stories of , the large chains like Walmart and Target are announcing price cuts\u2014McDonald \u2019s announcing a $5 meal deal.  So people may still be unhappy about prices  at the grocery store, but\n\nJune 12, 2024   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nit doesn \u2019t seem like there \u2019s a lot of inflationary pressure left in this economy \u2014and wonder if you could tell us more about that. CHAIR POWELL.  So  I, I think it \u2019s true that housing\u2014that inflationary pressures have come down.  But we still have\u2014we \u2019re still getting high inflation readings.  So, you know \u2014and I think you can see it in, in  various places in \u2014you know, in some parts of , of nonhousing services. You see elevated inflation still\u2014and that \u2019s probably to do with\u2014it could be to do with wages. Goods prices have kind of fluctuated.  There \u2019s been a surprising increase in , in import prices on goods, which is kind of hard to understand.  And, you know, may , may \u2014we\u2019ve taken some signal from that, but, you know \u2014and, and, of course, housing services.  You \u2019re seeing \u2014you\u2019re continuing to see high readings there to some extent.  That \u2019s, that\u2019s, you know, catch- up inflation from earlier pressures.  But, I mean, overall, you \u2019re right.  Inflationary pressures have come down.  As I mentioned, the labor market has come into better balance.  Wages are still running, you know, I would say, above a , a sustainable path, which would be that of trend inflation and trend productivity.  You \u2019re still seeing wage increases moving above that.  We, we haven \u2019t thought of wages as being the principal , you know, cause of inflation.  But at the same time, getting back to 2 percent inflation is likely to require a return to a more sustainable level, which is somewhat below the current level of increases in the aggregate. MICHELLE SMITH.  Rachel. RACHEL SIEGEL.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post .  Thanks for taking our questions.  There \u2019s obviously a lot of focus on how many cuts could be expected this year.  But can you give us a sense of what one cut by the end of the year would actually do to the economy\u2014what you think would be a meaningful difference  if there was a cut by the end of the year or even two?\n\nJune 12, 2024   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nCHAIR POWELL.  I think if, you know \u2014if you look back in 5 or 10 years and , and try to pull out the significance to the U .S. economy of one 25 bas is point rate cut, you\u2019 d, you\u2019d have quite a job on your hands.  So  that\u2019s not how we look at it \u2014you know , really, the whole rate path matters.  And I , I do continue to think that when\u2014you know, when we do start to loosen policy, that will show up in a  significant loosening in  financial market conditions.  And the market will price in what it prices in.   I don\u2019t \u2014I have no way of saying\u2014 we\u2019re, we \u2019re not at that stage, so I don\u2019 t know what we \u2019ll be thinking about at that time.  But it \u2019s a consequential decision for the economy.  And, you know, you want to\u2014you want to get it right.  And , fortunately, we have a strong economy, and we , we have the ability to, you know, approach this question carefully.  And we will approach it carefully while we \u2019re very much keeping an eye on, you know, downside economic risks , should they \u2014should they emerge. RACHEL SIEGEL.  And you \u2019ve been talking about this clear sense that it \u2019s just going to take longer to have the confidence that \u2019s needed for rate cuts.   Is there something about what happened in the first couple of months of the year that you \u2019re seeing differently now with more time or hindsight?  Do you still characterize it as expected bumpiness or something more lasting that is affecting your policy for the rest of the year? CHAIR POWELL.  You know, we always want to avoid the tendency to dismiss the parts of inflation that we \u2014that we don \u2019t like and just make it go away.  So \u2014but we had a quarter where inflation was running higher , and, yes, I could stand here and say, \u201cI t\u2019s stuff we shouldn\u2019 t have taken signal from.\u201d   But it is what it is .  You know, you, you have to \u2014you know, low inflation is low inflation .  High\u2014so i f you have a quarter where it \u2019s higher \u2014we tried not to take signal from the first couple of months, but we got a third month, and we said, \u201cOkay, the signal we \u2019re taking is that, you know, we think it \u2019s going to take longer to get confidence  that\n\nJune 12, 2024   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\ninflation is moving sustainably down to 2 percent.\u201d  That \u2019s, that\u2019s what we said.  I think that was the right thing to do.  I still think that\u2019 s the right thing to do.  Now we have today \u2019s inflation reading, which is very different \u2014very much more positive.  We\u2019re going to have to see what the trend is \u2014what \u2019s, what\u2019s  going to be the data going forward.  We\u2019 re looking for something that gives us confidence that inflation is , is moving sustainably down to 2 percent.  And readings like today\u2019 s, you know \u2014that \u2019s a step in the right direction.  But, you know, one reading is \u2014isn\u2019t\u2014 it just\u2014it\u2019s  only one reading.  You don\u2019 t want to \u2014you don\u2019t want to be too motivated by any single data point. MICHELLE SMITH.   Jo Ling. JO LING KENT.   Hi, Chair Powell.   Thank you for taking our questions.  I \u2019m Jo Ling Kent , with CBS News.  What \u2019s your message to Americans who are seeing encouraging economic data  but don \u2019t feel good about this economy? CHAIR POWELL.  I, you know \u2014I, I don\u2019 t think anyone knows \u2014has a definitive answer why people are , are not as happy about the economy as they might be.  And we don\u2019 t tell people how they should think or feel about the economy.  That \u2019s not our job.  We \u2014you know, people experience what they experience.  All I can tell you is what the \u2014what the  data show, which is , we\u2019ve got an economy that \u2019s growing at a solid pace.  W e\u2019ve got a very strong labor market with unemployment at 4 percent.  It \u2019s been a long time sinc e we\u2019ve had, you know, a long stretch of time with unemployment at or below 4 percent\u2014 very long time.  We had a period of high inflation.   We\u2014inflation has come down really significantly, and we \u2019re doing everything we can to\u2014you know, to bring that inflationary episode fully to a halt and fully restore price stability. We\u2019re confident that we \u2019ll get there.  And in the meantime, you know, it \u2019s going to be painful for, for people , but the ultimate pain would be a, a period of  long, high\u2014a long period of high\n\nJune 12, 2024   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\ninflation.   It is people who\u2014lower -income people \u2014people who are at the margins of the economy who, who have the worst experience\u2014 who experience the most pain from inflation. So, you know, it \u2019s for those people \u2014for all Americans , but particularly for those people \u2014that we\u2019re doing everything we can to bring inflation back down under control. JO LING KENT.  As just a quick follow -up here \u2014you\u2019 ve indicated one interest rate cut sometime this year.  And I know you don\u2019 t have a crystal ball up there , but a lot of people are watching and see, you know, borrowing money remains very expensive.  For everybody who\u2019 s out there waiting on a rate cut, about when can consumers expect some relief? CHAIR POWELL.  Well, you know, I , I don\u2019 t have a precise date for you.  But what we said is that we , we want to make sure that we \u2019re confident that inflation is actually moving back down to 2 percent.  And when we are, then we can look at loosening policy.  So having that kind of confidence that inflation will be at 2 percent  just\u2014it just pays benefits to the whole economy, to all Americans, for a long period of time.  We had that period for a very long time .  We very much want to get back to a place where people can , can  not think about inflation\u2014i t\u2019s just not a concern in the everyday economic decisions that they make.  We were ther e for a long time , and our goal is to get back to that place.  And we \u2019ve made good progress , and we \u2019re just \u2014we \u2019re in the phase now of just, you know, sticking with it until we get it done. MICHELLE SMITH.  Claire. CLAIRE JONES.  Claire Jones, Financial Times.   I\u2019m just drawing on the change in the statement on there being \u201cmodest further progress \u201d on inflation.  You know, halfway, you know, through the year and after today \u2019s CPI release, you know, what have you and other Committee members found that has been particularly encouraging to you?  And just in terms of the\n\nJune 12, 2024   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nconservatism, how much of that is about stickiness and shelter inflation in particular? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL.  So, encouraging has been that growth\u2014 you know, the growth, clearly , that we had last year, particularly the second half of last year, and we continue to see still-strong growth \u2014solid growth this year.  That \u2019s been very encouraging.  If you go back a year, there was a real concern about, you know, very much slowing growth and, and a recession \u2014many forecasters had that.   And that \u2019s not what happened.  Instead, we \u2014the U.S. is , anyway, and it \u2019s in\u2014it\u2019s in sharp distinction with many other advanced economies around the world.  So that \u2019s been encouraging.  I would say that the , the\u2014today\u2019 s inflation report is encouraging, but it comes after, you know, several reports that were not so encouraging. You asked about \u2014your second question was really about shelter inflation.   So I think if you go back a couple of years \u2014we, we know that there were renters , and then there  are, you know, people who own their houses .  And we have OER, which is owners \u2019 equivalent rent.  And so when market -based rents go up sharply, as they did at the beginning of the \u2014of the\u2014when the economy reopened, they really went up sharply.  Those play into rollover rents much more slowly for existing tenants than they do for new tenants.  And , and so  what we \u2014so we, we \u2019ve found now that there are big lags.  So  there \u2019s sort of  a\u2014there\u2019s  a bulge of high past increases in , in market rents.   It has to get worked off , and that may take, you know, several years. Nonetheless, as long as market rents remain \u2014are going at \u2014up at relatively low levels \u2014and they still are \u2014you know, this , this  is just going to happen.  It just is going to happen more slowly than we thought. You know, we , we also do sort of this thing where we impute a rental value to , to owned homes.  And that \u2019s\u2014you know, many countries around the world do that.  Some do it differently\n\nJune 12, 2024   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nthan us.  It \u2019s something that the \u2014you know, that the , the price experts have regularly looked at. It is not something that we \u2019re the only country that does, and it \u2019s not something we \u2019re looking at changing or would look at changing, you know, anytime soon.  But it\u2014it\u2019 s true.  It \u2019s one of the very hardest things in, in inflation and in prices is how to think about, you know, the services that someone is getting by living in a home that they could rent, but they \u2019re actually living in it. And some countries \u2014you should just ignore that.  But that \u2019s not our \u2014that\u2019s not how we do inflation here.  We, we  do it the way we do it , and we \u2019ve been very transparent about it.  And, you know, it \u2019s true that we \u2019re\u2014we\u2019re seeing delays in , in realizing what \u2014what \u2019s happening economically .  But we understand that \u2014you know, we understand that very well. MICHELLE SMITH.  Edward. EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Edward Lawrence, with Fox Business.  Thank you for taking the question, Chair Powell.  So I want to go back to jobs and the consumer.  The last jobs report show ed that over the past year, 634,000 more people took multiple jobs.  That \u2019s up 8.2 percent. And since January of 2021, we \u2019ve seen prices rise 19 percent.  So people are using their credit cards to pay for their lifestyle.  What pressure points will signal to you that the slowing economy could maybe break companies in terms of hiring or break the consumer in terms of spending? CHAIR POWELL.  So, you know, we monitor all the things you mentioned and more . You know , what we \u2019re seeing is, basically , spending was going up faster than disposable income during big parts of next year , so\u2014last year, rather \u2014and so what  that\u2014you\u2019d expect to see is people spending more on their credit cards .  That \u2014that has been happening.  Credit card balances have been going up.  C redit card defaults have been going up.  T hey\u2019re not at high levels.   Remember that after the pandemic, people were cooped up.  T hey couldn\u2019 t spend money. They couldn \u2019t go out to spend money ; they could spend money from home .  But households\n\nJune 12, 2024   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nwere in very, very strong \u2014historically strong \u2014financial shape.  They \u2019ve now worked off a lot of that.  So  we\u2019re, we\u2019re  watching that carefully.  And, you know, what do we see?  That \u2019s what we see.  We, we  see the same data that everybody else sees, but you \u2019ve still got a household sector that \u2019s in\u2014that\u2019s in  pretty good shape .  You know \u2014but , nonetheless, it \u2019s not in the kind of shape it was in a year or two ago.  And we \u2019re, you know \u2014we \u2019re carefully watching that. EDWARD LAWRENCE.  So how close  then are we to that point where the consumer can\u2019t continue to spend as it\u2019s spending or companies can \u2019t hire like they \u2019re hiring? CHAIR POWELL.   So consumer spending is still growing.  It \u2019s not growing at the pace it was growing at a year or so ago, but , but it\u2019s still \u2014it\u2019 s still growing solidly.  And, by the way, other parts of the economy are picking up.  Spending on equipment and intangibles is \u2014has picked up quite a bit, you know, in the wake of all the construction that we saw of new tech\u2014 you know, tech plants.  So, overall, the economy is exhibiting solid growth, and, you know \u2014 something around 2 percent \u2014which is \u2014which is, you know, good\u2014a good pace of growth for the U.S. economy.  But , no, you\u2019 re, you\u2019re  right, though.  We, we  do see the same thing other people see, which is, you know, increasing financial pressures on, you know, more lower -income people.  And, and, you know, the best thing we can do is , is to foster a very strong jobs economy, which we think we have done \u2014ultimately to get inflation under control , because those people experience inflation, you know, very directly \u2014very painfully.  And, and, you know, once , once we get inflation under control, rates can come down\u2014which , which will also improve things. MICHELLE SMITH.   Victoria. VICTORIA GUIDA.   Hi.  Victoria Guida with Politico.  You \u2019ve mentioned that unexpected weakening in the labor market would, would bring rate cuts sooner.  And I was just wondering \u2014can you talk a little bit about what that would look like?  Is it more of, like , a\n\nJune 12, 2024   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nquicker pace of people losing jobs?   Is it more the level of the unemployment rate if it were to start to go above 4.2 or something like that?  How are you thinking about what you\u2019 re looking for to see the job market unexpectedly weaken? CHAIR POWELL.  You know \u2014you know, when I say \u201c unexpectedly,\u201d  the first thing is more than , kind of , is in our forecast or in common forecasts \u2014so, something more than that . But we \u2019ll be looking at everything.  Y ou know , we\u2019ll\u2014 the, the labor market, you know, has the ability \u2014has , has the tendency sometimes to , to weaken quickly.  So waiting for that to happen is , is not what we \u2019re doing.  You know, we \u2019re watching very carefully ; we\u2019re looking at the balance of risks.  I always point out the balance of risks , so\u2014and, and also the fact that we look at , at all of it\u2014 the whole situation.  So, you know, a decision to begin to\u2014you know, to loosen policy could have several reasons associated with it at a given time.  But I, you know, I would just \u2014 you know, we monitor all the \u2014all the labor market data.  A nd if we saw troubling\u2014weakening more than \u2014more than expected, then that would be something we \u2019d consider responding to.  B ut we\u2019d look at the \u2014we look at the  broader context of what \u2019s going on, too. VICTORIA GUIDA.   So something like negative payroll numbers would be \u2014 CHAIR POWELL.  I \u2019m not going to \u2014yeah, I mean, I , I can think of things that would\u2014 many things would make it on that list, but I don \u2019t think I \u2019ll, I\u2019ll utter them here. SIMON RABINOVITCH.  Thank you, Chair Powell.  Simon Rabinovitch with t he Economist.  May I ask \u2014you mentioned, with the slightly higher PCE  [inflation] readings earlier this year , that it wasn \u2019t one or two months but three months that tipped you to be a bit more cautious in the rate outlook.  Should we take from that  that\u2014you know, it looks like May will be quite good for PC E [inflation ], as it was for CPI \u2014does that imply that kind of two more good\n\nJune 12, 2024   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nmonths would reinstill the confidence that rate cuts could be coming sooner than you currently project? CHAIR POWELL.  You know, I , I don\u2019 t actually have that kind of mechanical thing in, in my thinking.  I , I get that, you know \u2014as many good ones as we had bad ones \u2014but it \u2019s not like that.  It\u2019s the whole.  It\u2019s going to be the totality of the data \u2014[including] l abor market data , the growth data .  In terms of inflation, you know, you\u2019 d, you\u2019d want to see real progress that builds your confidence that we\u2019re \u2014that we are on a path down to 2 percent.  And I , I don\u2019 t want to try to give you specific numbers of things , because that points to dates , and I , I just don\u2019 t think\u2014we \u2019re not at a point of being able to do that. MICHELLE SMITH.  Kosuke. KOSUKE TAKAMI.  Thank you for doing this.  I, I am Kosuke Takami , with Nikkei.   I would like to know about the impact of a stronger dollar on U.S. economic growth and prices. And I have no doubt that markets should determine the exchange rate, but in \u2014Japan and some emerging market s are suffering from  the strong d ollar.  So  I want to know if it is having a positive impact on U.S. economy in total?  Thank you. CHAIR POWELL.   So we don\u2019 t\u2014actually , it\u2019s our \u2014it\u2019s our  finance ministry , the Treasury Department , that has a responsibility for thinking about and , and, if it sees fit, doing things about the level of the dollar.  So for us, it \u2019s just another financial variable.  And you\u2019 re right \u2014the dollar has been\u2014has exhibited, exhibited some strength over the course of the last year or so because the U.S. economy is very strong.  We don\u2019 t think of it as benefiting or hurting the U.S.  We don\u2019 t\u2014again, we don\u2019 t manage the level of the dollar.  That \u2019s, that\u2019s not our \u2014 that\u2019s not our job.  It \u2019s not .  You know \u2014and for , for our economy, what , you know, we \u2019re trying\n\nJune 12, 2024   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nto foster is maximum employment and price stability.  And we feel like we\u2019 ve made good progress on, on  both of those goals over the course of the past year. MICHELLE SMITH.   Jennifer. JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.  Thank you, Chair Powell.  Jennifer Schonberger , with Yahoo Finance.  You said you would cut rates before inflation falls to 2 percent.  You \u2019re forecasting inflation to end the year at 2.8 percent on core PCE .  We\u2019re at 2.8 percent, of course, on core PCE.  Right now, you said the inflation forecast is conservative and that if you got to 2.6 to 2.7 [percent] on PCE  [inflation], that would be  a good place to be.  You also indicated the job market has mostly normalized.  So  why not cut rates this summer j ust once \u2014you\u2019 re well above neutral \u2014to try to preserve the soft landing rather than risking waiting too long in  the quest for confidence for inflation? CHAIR POWELL.  You know \u2014so we are\u2014we \u2019re well aware of the two -sided risks here, let me just say.  We, we understand that if we wait too long, that could come at the cost of economic activity, of employment, of the expansion.  We understand that if we move too, too quickly, we could end up undoing a lot of the good that we \u2019ve done and have to then start over, and it c ould be very disruptive.  So  we\u2019re, we\u2019re  extremely aware of both of those risks and , and just basically trying to manage them.  And what we sa id is that we\u2019ll \u2014that we\u2019re \u2014we don\u2019 t think it \u2019ll be appropriate to , to begin to loosen policy until we \u2019re more confident that inflation is moving down to 2 percent over time on a sustainable basis.  That\u2019s \u2014that\u2019s kind of been our test. Or there \u2019s another test, which is, you know, an unexpected deterioration in labor market conditions.  So I think that\u2019 s, that\u2019s  the right way for us to think about it.  That\u2019s our \u2014that\u2019s our dual mandate there.  And, you know, we , we have a strong economy.  W e\u2019ve got growth\u2014all forecasts are very commonly around 2 percent.  That \u2019s a\u2014 that\u2019s a  strong growth rate for our\n\nJune 12, 2024   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\neconomy.  The labor market continues to print jobs at a pretty high rate.  Unemployment  is still low.  So  we have the ability  now  to approach this question carefully, and that \u2019s, that\u2019s  what we\u2019re doing. JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.  And just  to follow, Chair Powell \u2014do you need to be ahead of a weakening in the labor market?  Otherwise, is it too late , given that the labor market is a lagging indicator \u2014right ?\u2014when you look at the monthly jobs data? CHAIR POWELL.  Yeah, we,  we completely understand that that\u2019 s the risk.  And that \u2019s, that\u2019s not what we\u2019re \u2014that\u2019s not our plan is to wait for things to break and then try to fix them. We\u2019re, we\u2019re  trying to balance these two goals in a way that is consistent with our framework , and we think we \u2019re doing that. MICHELLE SMITH.  Evan. EVAN RYSER.  Thank you, Chair Powell.  Evan Ryser with Market News International. You have mentioned before the framework review process will start in the latter half of the year. At this point, do you have any specific time  frame for the start of that?  Who will lead it?  Will you be \u2014will it be you or a member \u2014a C ommittee group of your \u2014of your  peers?  What will be the parameters?  Do you anticipate the review will consider changes in communications going forward? CHAIR POWELL.  So  we\u2014what, what we \u2019ve been thinking is that we would announce and commence the review later or late in the year.   In the meantime, as that time approaches, we will be devoting a lot of careful thought and planning to the contours of it.  Within scope would certainly be communications generally.  I \u2014I\u2019m not going to say that we \u2019ll look at this or that particular thing.  And all the other details, you know \u2014we \u2019re just \u2014we don\u2019 t want to get\n\nJune 12, 2024   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nprematurely into a conversation until it\u2019 s really time to have it.   And so, you know, I \u2019m going to leave pretty much everything else to, to later in the year. MICHELLE SMITH.  Go to Nancy, for the last question. NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Nancy Marshall -Genzer , with Marketplace.  Just one more question on housing \u2014can you still cut rates with shelter prices high , or will you wait until they start to moderate a bit? CHAIR POWELL.  I wouldn\u2019 t\u2014there isn \u2019t any one thing\u2014 one variable , like housing prices moderating , that would really decide or decide against what we\u2019 re doing.  We\u2019 ve got an overall test, which is greater confidence that inflation is moving down to 2 percent on a sustainable basis.   That \u2019s our overall test.  Or , alternatively, we see unexpected weakening in the labor market.  So those  are\u2014those are two different tests.  I would say, you know, we \u2019re not \u2014 we\u2019re not looking at any one price in any one sector and saying, \u201c That\u2019s the one.\u201d  We don\u2019 t target housing prices, for example.  And we  don\u2019t target wages.  We, we  target aggregate prices and overall employment, so\u2014 NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  But if housing prices remain sticky, could that slow down the pace of rate cuts? CHAIR POWELL.  I think you\u2019 d look at the over \u2014we \u2019d be looking at the aggregate numbers and, and asking ourselves, \u201cWhat \u2019s going on here with inflation in the \u2014at the aggregate level? \u201d  And, you know \u2014and, of course, if, if\u2014any price that contributed to ongoing inflation would , would matter .  Any price that contributed to ongoing disinflation would matter , too, but I wouldn\u2019 t single out housing as having a , a special role there. Thank you very much."

My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on achieving our dual -mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of the American people.  Our economy has made considerable progress toward both goals over the past two years.   The labor market has come into better balance , and the unemployment rate remains low.   Inflation has eased substantially from a peak of 7 percent to 2.5 percent.   We are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2\u202fpercent goal in support of a strong economy that benefits everyone. Today, the F OMC decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings.  We are maintaining our restrictive stance of monetary policy in order to keep demand in line with supply and reduce inflationary pressures.  We are att entive to risks on both sides of our dual mandate, and I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments. Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace.   GDP growth moderated to 2.1 percent in the first half of the year, down from 3.1 percent last year.   Private domestic final purchases, or PDFP\u2014which excludes inventory investment, government spending, and net exports and usually sends a clearer signal of  underlying demand\u2014 grew at a 2.6\u202fpercent pace over that same period, the first half.  Growth of consumer spending has slowed from last year\u2019s robust pace but remains solid.  Investment in equipment and intangibles has picked up from its anemic pace last year.   In the housing sector, investment stalled in the second quarter after a strong rise in the first.   Improving supply conditions have supported resilient demand and the strong performance of the U.S. economy over the past year.\n\nJuly 31, 202 4   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nIn the labor market, supply and demand conditions have come into better balance. Payroll job gains averaged 177,000 jobs per month in the second quarter \u2014a solid pace, but below that seen in the first quarter.   The unemployment rate has moved up but remains low at 4.1\u202fpercent.  Strong job creation over the past couple of years has been accompanied by an increase in the supply of workers, reflecting increases in participation among individuals aged 25 to 54 years and a strong pace of immigration.   Nominal wage growth has eased over the past year, and the jobs -to-workers gap has narrowed.  Overall, a broad set of indicators suggests that conditions in the labor market have returned to about where they stood on the eve of the pandemic \u2014strong, but not overheated. Inflation has eased notably over the past two years but remains somewhat above our longer -run goal of 2\u202fpercent.  Total PCE prices rose 2.5 percent over the 12 months ending in June; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.6 percent.   Longer -term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households and businesses and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship , as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.  Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for t he American people.  In support of these goals, the Committee decided at today\u2019s meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5 \u00bc to 5\u00bd percent and to continue reducing our securities holdings.  As the labor market has cooled and infla tion has declined, the risks to achieving our employment\n\nJuly 31, 202 4   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nand inflation goals continue to move into better balance.  Indeed, we \u2019re attentive to the risks to both sides of our dual mandate. We\u2019ve stated that we do not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate until we have gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.  The second quarter\u2019s inflation readings have added to our confidence, and more good data would further strengthen that confidence.  We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting.  We know that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could result in  a reversal of the progress we have seen on inflation.  At the same time, reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment.  In considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. As the economy evolves, monetary policy will adjust in order to best promote our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.  If the economy remains solid and inflation persists, we can maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate as long as appropriate. If the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated, we are prepared to respond.  Policy is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandat e. The Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy\u2014 maximum employment and stable prices.   We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keeping longer -term inflation expectations well anchored.  Restoring price stabi lity is essential to achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.  Our success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans.   We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country.   Everything we do is in service to our\n\nJuly 31, 202 4   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\npublic mission.  We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.  Thank you.  I look forward to your questions. MICHELLE SMITH.  Jeanna. JEANNA SMIALEK.   Jeanna Smialek from the New York Times.  T hanks for taking our questions.  Markets pretty much entirely expect a rate cut in September at this stage.  I wonder if you think that \u2019s a reasonable expectation , and, if so, why not just make the move today? CHAIR POWELL.  Thank you.  S o on September, let me say this .  We, we have made no decisions about future meetings , and that includes the September meeting.  The broad sense of the C ommittee is that the economy is moving closer to the point at which it will be appropriate to reduce our policy rate.  In that, we will be data dependent but not data point dependent, so it will not be a question of responding specifically to one or two data releases.  The question will be whether the totality of the data, the ev olving outlook, and the balance of risks are consistent with rising confidence on inflation and maintaining a solid labor market.  If that test is met, a reduction in our policy rate could be on the table as soon as the next meeting in September. So you asked, why not today?  And I would just say, again, that the broad sense of the Committee is that we \u2019re getting closer to the point at which it will be appropriate to reduce our policy rate but that we \u2019re not quite at that point yet. MICHELLE SMITH.  Howard. HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  So just to, to follow  up on that a bit , if inflation behaves as you expect between now and September, would you regard a cut in September as sort of the baseline scenario right now? CHAIR POWELL.  So I guess I would\u2014I would think about it this way .  I\u2019ll give an example of , of cases in which it would be appropriate to cut and maybe that it wouldn\u2019 t be\n\nJuly 31, 202 4   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nappropriate to cut.  So if we were to see, for example, inflation moving down quickly or more or less in line with expectations, growth remains , let\u2019s say , reasonably strong, and the labor market remains , you know, consistent with its current condition, then I would think that a , a rate cut could be on the table at the September meeting. If, if inflation were to prove , you know, sticky and we were to see higher readings from inflation, disappointing readings, we would weigh that along with the other things.  You know, I think it \u2019s going to be not just any one thing.  I t\u2019s going to be the inflation data , it\u2019s going to be the employment data , it\u2019s going to be the balance of risks as we see it \u2014it\u2019s going to be the totality of all of that that would help us make this decision. HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  And just to follow  up on that \u2014specifically , in what ways right now, given all you\u2019 ve seen over the last few months, in particular on shelter, on services, et cetera, in what ways are you not confident right now that inflation is on the way back to 2 percent? CHAIR POWELL.   I, I think it \u2019s just a question of seeing more good data.  We have seen\u2014the last couple of readings have , have  certainly added to confidence .  And we \u2019ve seen progress across all three categories of core PCE inflation \u2014that\u2019s goods , nonhousing services , and housing services.  So it \u2019s really just\u2014you know, we had a quarter of poor inflation data at the beginning of the year .  Then we saw some more good inflation data ; we had seven months at the end of last year.  You know, w e just want to see mo re and , and gain confidence .  And, as I said, we have\u2014we did gain confidence , and more good data would cause us to, to gain more confidence. HOWARD SCHNEIDER.   Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH.  Colby.\n\nJuly 31, 202 4   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nCOLBY SMITH.  Thank you.  Colby Smith with the Financial Times.   The March  SEP pointed to three cuts in 2024, with core inflation at 2.6 percent and the unemployment rate at 4 percent.  Since we\u2019 re now at that level in terms of inflation and already beyond what was projected for the labor market, I \u2019m just wondering if that rate path is back to being the best guidepost for policy rather than, let\u2019s say , the shallower one laid out in that June SEP. CHAIR POWELL.  You know, s o I would just say, really, the path ahead is going to depend on the way the economy evolves.  And I can\u2019 t really give you any, any better forward guidance on it than that.  We didn\u2019 t, of course, do an SEP at this meeting.  We will do another one at the September meeting.  I would just say, I can \u2014I can  imagine a scenario in which there would be everywhere from zero cuts to several cuts, depending on the way the economy evolves , and I wouldn\u2019 t want to lay out a baseline path for you there today.  I \u2019ve said what I \u2014what I  can say about September and about today , though. MICHELLE SMITH.  Nick. NICK TIMIRAOS.  Nick Timiraos  of the Wall Street Journal.   Chair Powell, you \u2019ve said before that you wouldn\u2019 t wait until inflation got to 2 percent to cut rates because of how inflation has lagged.  Does that apply for the labor market , too?  If the labor market is back in equilibrium, why is restrictive policy and , potentially, very restrictive policy, given the high real funds rate, warranted right now? CHAIR POWELL.  So this is the very reason that we \u2019re thinking about \u2014that we \u2019ve said in our\u2014in our statement that we \u2019re going back to looking at both mandates and that we think the risks are coming back into balance.  We think what the data broadly show in the labor market is an ongoing, gradual normalization of labor market conditions.  And that \u2019s what we want to see. You know, w e\u2019ve seen that over a period of a couple of years and a move , really , from\n\nJuly 31, 202 4   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\noverheated conditions to more normal conditions.  We are watching the labor market conditions quite closely , and that \u2019s what we \u2019re seeing.  If we \u2014if we  start to see something that looks to be more than that, then we \u2019re well  positioned to respond.  That \u2019s, that\u2019s  part of what we \u2019re thinking. NICK TIMIRAOS.  And when you talk about seeing something that \u2019s more than whatever softness or slowdown you expect, in the past you\u2019 ve said that stronger growth wouldn\u2019 t, wouldn\u2019t  override better news on inflation.  I wonder how that cuts the other way.  If you\u2019re seeing more softness in the labor market than what you would expect, does that change the calculus on what you\u2019 re looking for out of the inflation numbers to recalibrate policy? CHAIR POWELL.  So w e have , we have \u2014growth isn \u2019t one of our three.  We have two mandates, as you know .  The labor market, maximum employment is one , and stable prices is another.  So we weigh \u2014we weigh  those two things equally under the law.  When we were far away from our inflation mandate, we had to focus on that.  Now we \u2019re back , back to a closer to even focus, so we \u2019ll be looking at labor market conditions and asking whether we \u2019re getting what we\u2019re seeing . And, as I said, we\u2019 re prepared to respond if we see that it \u2019s\u2014that it\u2019s  not what we wanted to see, which was , you know, a gradual normalization of conditions \u2014if we see more than that . And it wouldn\u2019 t be any one statistic, although, of course , the unemployment rate is generally thought to be , you know, a single \u2014a good single statistic .  But we \u2019d be looking at wages , we\u2019d be looking at participation, w e\u2019d be looking at all the things \u2014surveys, quits, hires, all of those things \u2014to determine the overall status of the labor market.   But we \u2019re looking at it now. I would say,  again, I think you\u2019 re back to conditions that are close to 2019 conditions, and that was not an inflationary economy\u2014broadly similar labor markets then .  I think inflation was actually \u2014core inflation was actually running below 2 percent.  So we don\u2019 t think \u2014I don\u2019 t\n\nJuly 31, 202 4   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nnow think of the labor market in its current state as a likely source of significant inflationary pressures.  So I would\u2014I would not like to see  a material further cooling in the labor market, and that\u2019s part of what \u2019s behind our thinking.  The other part, of course, is that we have made real progress on inflation.  And  we\u2019re \u2014we\u2019ve got growing confidence there that we are not quite there yet, but we \u2019re more confident that we\u2019re on  a\u2014that we \u2019re on a sustainable path down to 2 percent.  So those two things ar e working together , and we \u2019re factoring those both into our policy. MICHELLE SMITH.  Chris. CHRIS TOPHER RUGABER.  Chris Rugaber  at Associated Press.  You mentioned not wanting to see any further cooling in the job market .  Why not ?  Or would you consider preemptive cuts to prevent if you saw risks of an unexpected cooling?   Is that something you would cut ahead of time for? CHAIR POWELL.   So I wouldn\u2019 t say I wouldn\u2019 t want to see any other cooling.  I t would be more of  a material difference.  If we \u2014if we \u2019d be looking at this and if we see something that looks like a more significant downturn, that would be something that we would\u2014we would have the intention of responding to.  So , in terms of\u2014I don\u2019 t think of it that way.  I think of it as , you know, we \u2019re actually in a good place here .  We\u2019re balancing these two risks of , you know, go too soon, and you undermine progress on inf lation ; wait too long or don\u2019 t go fast enough, and, and you put at risk the recovery.  And so we have to balance those two things .  That\u2019s the nature of having two mandates , and I think we \u2014this is how we balance them.  It\u2019s a rough balance, but it does feel like, again, the labor market feels like it \u2019s in a place where it \u2019s just a process of ongoing normalization;  4.1 percent unemployment is still historically low .  And, you know, we \u2019ll just have to see what the data show us.\n\nJuly 31, 202 4   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nCHRIS TOPHER RUGABER.  And , just to follow  up quickly:  [I] wanted to see what you thought of the recent JOLTS r eport, which did show hiring, gross hiring, has come down even below 2019 levels.  Layoffs remain low .  So it painted a picture of a very static labor market.  Is that sustainable in your view or something that is worrying?  Thank you. CHAIR POWELL.  So I think all of the data points continue to point to kind of the direction we would want to see .  So that was taken as, you know, there was a decline in job openings .  That was good.  T oday\u2019 s ECI reading was a little softer than expected, so that \u2019s, that\u2019s a good reading.  I t shows that wage increases are still at a strong level but that that level continues to come down to more sustainable levels over time.  That \u2019s exactly the pattern that we want to be seeing.  So I think the data \u2014the dat a we\u2019ve been seeing in the labor market are broadly consistent with that normalization process.  Again, we \u2019re closely monitoring to see whether it starts to show signs that it\u2019 s more than that. MICHELLE SMITH.  Steve. STEVE LIESMAN.  Steve Liesman, CNBC.  Mr. Chairman, back in March, you talked about cutting rates as a process, and , in June , you talked about the idea that , well,  one rate cut wouldn\u2019 t do anything.  So I wonder if you can sort of \u2014follow ing up on Colby\u2019 s question\u2014talk about , are you weighing the economy right now in terms of its ability to withstand multiple rate cuts?  Talk us through the process that you think\u2014or is it just one rate cut?  Or a re you in the process now of thinking that rates need to be nor malized here?  Thank you. CHAIR POWELL.  Yeah, I can \u2019t really say that, honestly.  You know, we\u2019re \u2014we \u2014 we\u2019ve seen significant movement in the labor market , and, you know, we \u2019re very mindful of this question of, is it just normalization or is it more?  We think it \u2019s just normalization, but we want to be in a position to, to support the labor market.   At the same time , we\u2019re seeing progress on\n\nJuly 31, 202 4   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\ninflation.  So , you know, we actually got to this \u2014we raised rates a year ago at the July meeting . And if you look at the situation in the economy a year ago, unemployment \u2014sorry , inflation was over 4 percent .  It was a completely different economy.  Now we \u2019ve made a lot of progress , and the labor market\u2014I think unemployment was in the 3s, mid -3s, so it \u2019s a different economy .  And I think it \u2019s time, it \u2019s coming to be time , to adjust that so that we support this continued process. The thing we \u2019re trying to do is \u2014you know that we have, we \u2019ve had this really significant decline in inflation , and unemployment has remained low .  And this is a really unusual and historically, historically unusual and such a welcome outcome for the people we serve.  What we\u2019re thinking about all the time is, how do we keep this going?  And this is \u2014this is  part of that. We think we don\u2019 t need to be 100 percent focused on inflation because of the progress we\u2019 ve made :  12-month headline at 2\u00bd [percent] , core at 2.6.  You know, it\u2019 s way down from where it was.  The job is not done on inflation, but , nonetheless, we can afford to begin to dial back the restriction in our policy rate.  And I think we\u2019re just \u2014it\u2019s part of a process. In terms of what that looks like, I mean , I think most rate \u2014you would think, in a base case, that policy rates would move down from here, but I don\u2019 t want to try to give specific forward guidance about when that might be, the pace at which it might happen, because I think that\u2019s really going to depend on the economy, and that \u2019s highly uncertain. MICHELLE SMITH.  Rachel. RACHEL SIEGEL.  Hi , Chair Powell.  Rachel Sieg el from the Washington Post.  Thanks for taking our questions.  On inflation, do the past few months of good reports look like what we saw last year, where you really had a lot of momentum, with a few bumps in between?   Would you characterize that kind of momentum as back on track at this point in the year?\n\nJuly 31, 202 4   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nCHAIR POWELL.  Actually , what we \u2019re seeing now is a little better than what we saw last year.   Last year, as we pointed out late in the year, a whole lot of the progress we saw last year was from goods pr ices, which were going down at an unsustainable rate, disinflating at an unsustainable rate.  This is a broader disinflation .  This has goods prices coming down, but  it\u2019s also\u2014we \u2019re also now seeing progress in the other two big categories :  nonhousing services and housing services.  So , you know, the thing i s, we\u2019ve only\u2014you \u2019ve got one quarter of that .  We had seven months of low inflation ; you got one quarter of this.  I would say the quality of this is , is higher , and it \u2019s good, but so far , it\u2019s only a quarter.  So I think, you know, we need to see more to know that we \u2019re\u2014to have more confidence that we \u2019re on, on  a good path down to 2 percent. But as I mentioned, our confidence is growing because we \u2019ve been getting good data.  And things like the ECI r eport and, frankly , the softening in the labor market conditions , you know, give you more confidence that the economy\u2019 s not overheating .  It doesn \u2019t look like an overheating economy, and it looks like an economy that \u2019s normalizing. RACHEL SIEGEL.  And if we \u2019re to think about the first couple months of the year, is there any sense now that they were these blips that could have actually allowed for earlier rate cuts as were some of the projections going into 2024? CHAIR POWELL.  So the thing about \u2014if what it is is seasonality , and it could just be \u2014 it\u2019s very, very hard to, you know, to  do appropriate seasonal adjustments .  If that\u2019 s what it is, then that actually implies that, that  other months were under reporting too low inflation.  I f you smoothed it out, it \u2019s a zero -sum game.  And that \u2019s why we look at 12 months .  We look at 12 months because that takes all  of that out, all those effects out.  Twelve -month now is 2\u00bd percent headline, 2.6 percent core.  This is so m uch better than where we were even a year ago.  It\u2019 s a lot better.  Now, t he job is not done .  I want to stress that, and we \u2019re committed to\n\nJuly 31, 202 4   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\ngetting the job\u2014inflation sustainably under 2 percent, but we need to take note of that progress, and we need to weigh the risks to the labor market and the risks to our inflation target now more equally than we did a year ago. MICHELLE SMITH.  Michael McKee. MICHAEL MCKEE.  Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television.  I \u2019d like to ask you about the balance of risks as the American people see it.  At this point, is the risk greater to leave interest rates where they are, given the damage that higher interest rates do to the economy in slowing demand and raising prices?  Or is it more important for the American people that you keep rates where they are to bring inflation down? CHAIR POWELL.   I, I\u2014you know, I  think that we \u2019ve been given an assignment by Congress .  This is how we serve the American people is by achieving maximum employment and price stability, right?  And so in our , you know, quasi -constitutional document, the Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, we look at the two goals , and if one of them is farther away than the other\u2014the two variables , inflation and employment\u2014 if one is farther away from its goal than the other, then you , you concentrate on the one that \u2019s farther away.  And you take account  of the time to reach the goal. So, for the last couple of years , the best service we could do to the American people was to focus on inflation.  But as inflation has come down \u2014and I think the upside risks to inflation have decreased as the labor market has cooled off, and now  the labor market has softened \u2014you know, probably the inflation, inflation \u2019s probably a little farther from its target than is employment, but I think the downside risks to, to  the employment mandate are , are real now.  So we have to weigh all that , and if you think about  where that takes us is we have a restrictive policy rate .  It\u2019s clearly restrictive.  I t\u2019s been the rate we\u2019 ve had in place for a full year .  And the\n\nJuly 31, 202 4   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\ntime is coming \u2014as other central banks around the world are facing the same question \u2014the time is coming at which it will begin to be appropriate to dial back that level of restrictions , restriction so that we may address both mandates. MICHAEL MCKEE.  Well , you have event risk basically, with the jobs report on Friday and another one before you meet again.  Are you certain that you won\u2019 t fall behind the curve and lead to unnecessary unemployment if you wait until September? CHAIR POWELL.  \u201c Certainty \u201d is not a word that we have in our \u2014in our  business.  So, you know, we get \u2014we get  a lot of data between now and September, and it isn \u2019t going to be one data read or even two .  It\u2019s going to be the totality of the data, all of the data, and not just \u2014and then how is that affecting the outlook?   And how is it affecting the balance of risks?  That \u2019s going to be the assessment that we do.  Of course , we\u2019ll, we \u2019ll all look carefully at the employment report, but so much other data coming in and so much happening between now and the September meeting, and we \u2019ll, you know, we\u2019ll make a judgment. MICHELLE SMITH.  Edward. EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Edward Lawrence of F ox Business.  I do want to dig deeper on what Michael and, and what Nick were asking.  There \u2019s a, a shift in the statement to balance between the focus between inflation and jobs.  Looking at the job sides, we \u2019ve seen wage data show sort of an abrupt slowing.  We\u2019ve \u2014we\u2019re hearing on earnings calls from companies like Intel abrupt layoffs.  In the jobs r eport from the BLS, government jobs has been a leading creator.  Could the government jobs \u2014as a sector \u2014hiring mask underlying weakness in the jobs r eport? CHAIR POWELL.  Well , you know, we \u2019ll look at everything.  We\u2019 ve seen some , some tendency to have a narrowing base of job creation in some months going back, but then we \u2019ve\n\nJuly 31, 202 4   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nhad some months where , where  job creation was broader.  And also , you know, the headline number of jobs has come down, so\u2014but you look at the whole thing.  A nd I think you do look at private demand extra carefully, to your point about , about  government.  So we \u2019ll just be looking at, at all those things. EDWARD LAWRENCE.   Just as a follow then \u2014so could the F ed then be behind the curve ?  Because you said some of the reports\u2014in the last meeting , you said the reports could be noisy or overstated.  Was there a discussion of , of\u2014what kind of discussion was there for a cut today, and could the F ed be \u201c behind the curve \u201d? CHAIR POWELL.  Yeah, so look, the objective is to balance the two risks, right?  It \u2019s the risk of going too soon and the risk of going too late.  We\u2019ve been \u2014you know, we , we had seven months of good inflation data at the end of last year .  We said we wanted to see more.  W e said\u2014we pointed out that too much of this was coming from goods, and, sure enough, the first quarter wasn \u2019t, wasn\u2019t  great \u2014inflatio n data .  And now we \u2019ve got another quarter \u2014a quarter that is good.  A nd, you know, we \u2019re balancing the risk  of going too soon against the risk of going too late.  That \u2019s what we \u2019re doing.  There \u2019s no guarantee in this .  It\u2019s a very difficult judgment call, but this is \u2014this is  how we \u2019re making it. So\u2014but in terms of today, your question about today, we did have a \u2014you know, we had a nice conversation about , about  this issue today.  The overall sense of the C ommittee, as I mentioned, is that we \u2019re getting closer to the point at which it will be appropriate to begin to dial back restriction, but we \u2019re not quite at that point yet.  We want to see more good data.  The decision was unanimous \u2014all 19 participants supported it.  B ut there was a real discussion back and forth of what the case would be for , for moving at this meeting.  A strong majority supported\n\nJuly 31, 202 4   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nmoving\u2014not moving at this meeting.  That was the strong sense of the C ommittee .  But it\u2019 s a conversation that we had today, certainly. MICHELLE SMITH.  Courtenay. COURTENAY BROWN.  Courtenay Brown from Axios.  Thank you for taking our questions.  When the F ed was raising rates, there was a lot of conversation about long and variable lags.  I wonder if that applies on the way down, too.  How are you and the C ommittee thinking about that? CHAIR POWELL.  Yes, it does.  And I think the lags have kind of showed up here in the last six months, by the way.  You , you really do now see the restriction, whereas, I mean , even a few months ago, people were questioning how restrictive policy was.  Look at the labor market now\u2014you can see.  A nd look at inflation\u2014sorry \u2014rate -sensitive, interest -sensitive spending. You really do see now that policy is restrictive.  I wouldn\u2019 t say it\u2019 s extremely restrict ive, but it \u2019s certainly effectively restrict ive.  Yes , there \u2014the lag should, should be on the way down.  I t should take some time to get into \u2014to get into  the full economy, a ffect financial conditions .  And that affects economic activity, hiring and that kind of thing , and, ultimately , inflation.  It doesn\u2019t \u2014it\u2019s not instantaneous , although it \u2019s faster than it used to be because markets move now in anticipation of our moves. COURTENAY BROWN.  So are you worried then that if monetary policy acts with long and variable lags, even when you\u2019 re lowering interest rates, it might be too late for the F ed to help stave off any kind of slowdown in the labor market or broader economy? CHAIR POWELL.  We have to worry about that.  I mean,  we\u2014just to make it clear, you know, it\u2019 s a very difficult , challenging judgment, and we don\u2019t  want to go too soon, and we don\u2019 t want to go too late.  But that \u2019s\u2014this is how we made that judgment.  I feel good about where we\n\nJuly 31, 202 4   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nare.  We \u2019re certainly very well  positioned to respond to weakness with the policy rate at 5.3 percent.  We certainly have a lot of room to respond if we were to see weakness.  That\u2019s not what we \u2019re seeing , though.  W hat we \u2019re seeing \u2014look at the \u2014look at the  first- half growth numbers .  Look at PDFP at 2.6 percent for the first half.  I t\u2019s not signaling a weak economy.  It \u2019s also not signaling an overheating economy. Labor market\u2014admittedly, the unemployment rate ha s moved up seven -tenths, and we \u2019re seeing \u2014we\u2019re seeing  normalization there, but wage , wage  increases are still at a high level . Unemployment is still at a low level.  Layoffs are very low .  Initial claims have moved up, but they\u2019 re pretty stable , and they\u2019 re historically not high at all.  So the total scope of the data suggest s a normalizing labor market,  and, again, we are carefully watching to see that that continues to be the case. MICHELLE SMITH.  Victoria. VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi.  Victoria Guida with Politico.  On the labor market, I was wondering, how worried are you all about unemployment rising to the point where it triggers the Sahm r ule, and would that potentially affect how quickly you cut rates? CHAIR POWELL.  We\u2014so I would just say, the question really is , is one of , are we worried about a sharper downturn in the labor market?  So, and the answer is, we \u2019re watching really carefully for that.  We\u2019re, we\u2019re  aware of that rule, which is really a,  you know, a \u2014I would call it a statistical, statistical  thing that has happened through history.  A \u201c statistical regularity \u201d is what I \u2019d call it.  It\u2019s not like an economic rule where it \u2019s telling you something must happen. So, again, what do we see?  What are our eyes telling us?  We look at \u2014we look at  all the things we \u2019re seeing, and what it looks like is a normalizing labor market \u2014again, job creation at a\n\nJuly 31, 202 4   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\npretty decent level, wages moving up at a strong level but coming down gradually.  J ob vacancies have come down, but they \u2019re still high by historical standards.  So, again, I \u2019ve been through some of the data already, but what we think we \u2019re seeing is, is  a normalizing labor market, and we \u2019re watching carefully to see if it \u2014if it turns out to be more .  If it starts to show signs that it \u2019s more than that, then we \u2019re well positioned to respond. VICTORIA GUIDA.   Is there reason to think that the labor market might behave differently this time than it has historically? CHAIR POWELL.  I think, you know, history doesn\u2019 t repeat itself;  it rhymes.   That statement is very true about the economy .  You never assume it \u2019s going to be just the same.  An example would be, is there a trend increase in the level of vacancies?  There are many, many examples, so it \u2019s never exactly the same.  Also, let \u2019s remember that this p andemic era has been one in which so many, you know, apparent rules have been flouted , like the inverted yield curve for starters.  So, many, many received \u2014pieces of received wisdom just haven \u2019t worked, and it \u2019s because this situation really is unusual or unique in that so much of this inflation came from the shutdown of the economy and the resulting supply problems in the face of, admittedly, very strong demand.  So the whole \u2014the whole  situation is not the same as many of the other prior inflation or downturns that we \u2019ve seen or business cycles that we \u2019ve seen.  So we \u2019re having to learn .  We\u2019re having to, to be very careful about the judgments that we make, I would say.  So we don\u2019 t assume that these regularities will, will  just repeat themsel ves automatically. MICHELLE SMITH.  Amara. AMARA OMEOKWE.  Thank you, Chair Powell .  Amara Omeokwe with Bloomberg. There seems to be quite a difference between what the anecdotal data are telling us, such as the very recent downbeat Beige Book, and the hard data.  Do you take those anecdotes seriously\u2014\n\nJuly 31, 202 4   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nthat is , that the economy and labor market are cooling much more rapidly than what \u2019s shown in the data ? CHAIR POWELL.  So I do take that seriously, and the Beige Book is great.  What \u2019s even greater is hearing the R eserve B ank presidents come in and talk about their conversations with , with businesses and business leaders and workers and people in the nonprofit sector in their Districts.  But I \u2019ll tell you, it\u2019 s a pretty \u2014the picture is , is not one of a slowing or , you know, a really bad economy.  I t\u2019s one of there are spots of weakness, and there are regions where growth is stronger than other regions, but , overall, it \u2019s\u2014again, look at the aggregate data.  The a ggregate data is\u2014particula rly PDFP, private domestic f inal purchases \u2014is 2.6 percent , and that \u2019s a good indicator of private \u2014of private  demand.  So we listen to all of that, and it does, does \u2014I think it\u2019s important to listen to anecdotal data and not just look at the aggregate data.  Especially , you know, it\u2019 s very hard \u2014GDP data can be volatile quarter to quarter.  So it \u2019s just hard to measure economic activity.  T here are a lot of \u2014it\u2019 s just difficult to do.  So I look at both, but I wouldn\u2019 t say that the \u2014that the  anecdotal data is uniformly downbeat .  It\u2019s more mixed. MICHELLE SMITH.  Jo Ling. JO LING KENT.  Thank you.  Jo Ling Kent with CBS News.  Chair Powell, thanks for taking our questions today.  You have consistently said that the F ed does not consider politics in making decisions.  With a possible September rate cut on the table, it would be less than two months before the election, and former President Trump reportedly said that cutting rates so close to the election is something the central bank knows \u201c they shouldn\u2019 t be doing.\u201d   What \u2019s your response , and do you believe it \u2019s possible to r eally remain apolitical with a  September rate cut?\n\nJuly 31, 202 4   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nCHAIR POWELL.  I absolutely do, and I think it \u2019s\u2014first of all, we haven \u2019t made any decisions.  I would say it this way:   haven \u2019t made any decision about any future meeting.  I don\u2019 t know what the data will reveal or how that will affect the appropriate path of our policy .  I really don\u2019t know.  I do know how we will make that assessment.  That \u2019s what I do know. So if you take a step back, the current situation , again , is inflation has come down much closer to our goal, and that \u2019s happened while unemployment has remained low.  We\u2019 re, we\u2019re very tightly focused on using our tools to try to foster that state of affairs continuing.  That\u2019s at each of our meetings and all of our decisions, our focus is strictly on that and really on nothing else\u2014doing our part, whatever that part may be.  You know, w e\u2019re using our best thinking. We\u2019re doing our best to understand the economy.   We, we follow academics.  W e follow the many commentators who bless us with their commentary  [laughter], but we don\u2019 t change anything in our approach to address other factors, like the political calendar. Congress has, we believe, ordered us to conduct our business in a nonpolitical way at all times, not just some of the time.  I \u2019ll say this , too:  We never use our tools to support or oppose a political party, a politician, or any political outcome.  The bottom line is, if we do our very best to do our part and we stick to our part, that will benefit all Americans.  If we get it right, the economy will be stronger .  We\u2019ll have price stability .  People will find jobs .  Wages will rise in real terms .  Everyone  will benefit.  So that \u2019s what we believe, and that \u2019s how we will always act. This is my fourth presidential election at the F ed.  I can tell you this is how we think about it. This is what we do.  So anything that we do before, during, or after the election will be based on the data, the outlook, and the balance of risks and not on anything else.\n\nJuly 31, 202 4   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nJO LING KENT.  Just a quick follow -up\u2014do your economic forecasts and models take into account the two very different economic plans of these two presidential candidates, Harris and Trump, and, if so, how? CHAIR POWELL.  No.  We do not do that.  We absolutely do not do that.  We don\u2019 t\u2014 we don\u2019t  know who\u2019 s going to win.  We don\u2019 t know what they\u2019 re going to do.  W e don\u2019 t act as though we know , and we just can \u2019t do that , you know ?  We basically \u2014we have our forecast . We\u2019re not \u2014we can run simulations of different potential policies, but we would never try to make policy decisions based on the outcome of an election that hasn\u2019 t happened yet.  We would just\u2014that would just be a line we would never cross.  You know, w e\u2019re a nonpolitical agency. We don\u2019 t want to be involved in any \u2014in politics in any way, so we wouldn\u2019 t do that. MICHELLE SMITH.  Nicholas. NICHOLAS JASINSKI.  Thank you, Chair Powell.  Nicholas Jasinski from Barron\u2019 s Magazine.  There hasn \u2019t been a dissenting vote on an interest rate decision in some time.   If the data do evolve as you expect, if you do have more confidence by the September meeting, do you get the sense that there will be a unanimous vote on an interest rate move in September? Basically, are there meaningful differences in C ommittee members \u2019 assessments of how much more confidence is needed? CHAIR POWELL.  So there\u2019s \u2014there are always meaningful differences.   There are. And, you know, we talk a lot before, during, and after the meeting.  We do have a very robust discussion of these things.  You \u2019re right that in , in most cases , people, if they feel heard and they feel that they \u2019ve\u2014that their position has been given serious consideration, for most people , most of the time , that \u2019s going to be enough.  There are dissents.  T hat\u2019s fine.  You know, no one has a veto.  N o single person has a veto, so it just is a question of, who will vote for and against ?\n\nJuly 31, 202 4   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nWe\u2019ve had \u2014we\u2019ve had, you know, dissents.  We haven \u2019t had so many during the pandemic era, and it just may be that we , we felt more united because we felt under a lot of pressure to get things right, but before the pandemic , we had plenty of dissents.  And dissents happen.  It\u2019s part of the process .  There\u2019s nothing wrong with dissents , and if it happens , it happens. MICHELLE SMITH.  Jean. JEAN YUNG.  Hello .  Jean Yung with MNI Market News.  Is a 50  basis point cut as a first cut at all likely or even on the table?  Thank you. CHAIR POWELL.  You know, I don\u2019 t want to say \u2014I don\u2019 t want to be really specific about what we \u2019re going to do, but that \u2019s, that\u2019s  not something we \u2019re thinking about right now. MICHELLE SMITH.  Jennifer. CHAIR POWELL.  Of course , we haven \u2019t made any decisions at all as of today. JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.  Thank you, Chair Powell.   Jennifer Schonberger with Yahoo Finance.  Not to get into the minutes , but you said there was a real discussion today for moving at this meeting.  I\u2019m curious if you could provide some more color on the nature of the discussion today at the meeting about a possible rate cut as early as September. CHAIR POWELL.  Well, so , you know, the way the meeting is set up , the first day there \u2019s a discussion of financial stability because it \u2019s every other meeting we have that , and then we have an opportunity to comment on that.  Then we have an economic go- round.  And then, this morning , we have the monetary policy go -round.  And I think in people \u2019s economic or in their monetary policy go -round, people express their views about this, and , you know, there \u2019s a range of views.  People \u2014as you will know from the spee ches that they give \u2014people have different ways of thinking about the economy.  And so, in the minutes , we\u2019ll lay this out in a much\u2014in a much better way than I can do off the cuff, but there \u2019s a range of perspectives.  A nd,\n\nJuly 31, 202 4   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nyou know \u2014but I do think that we are, we \u2019re a consensus- driven organization.  People come together .  This was a unanimous \u2014a unanimous  decision.  A nd, at the end, everyone , everyone supported the outcome \u2014not just the voters, but everyone.  So I would also say, some people examined the possibility,  you know, the case for moving at this meeting, but , overwhelmingly, the sense of the Committee  was not at this meeting but as soon as the next meeting, depending on how the data come in. JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.  But there is a growing sense of confidence that you could move at the next meeting \u2014 CHAIR POWELL.  Yes. JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.  \u2014assuming inflation comes ? CHAIR POWELL.  Well , assuming that the totality of the data supports such an outcome.  No question.  That\u2019s, that is the case, as I mentioned .  We think that the time is,  is\u2014 it\u2019s approaching, and if we do get the data that we \u2014that we  hope we get, then a reduction in our policy rate could be on the table at the September meeting. MICHELLE SMITH.  Nancy. NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Nancy Marshall -Genzer with Marketplace.  Former New York president Bill Dudley wrote an op- ed in Bloomberg earlier this month, which you probably saw, in which he said, \u201c It might already be too late to fend off a recession by cutting rates, dawdling now unnecessarily increases the risk. \u201d  Is he wrong? CHAIR POWELL.  So this is the judgment that we have to make , and we \u2019re, we\u2019re  well aware of the judgment.  We\u2019re\u2014as I \u2019ve said, we have to weigh the risk of going too soon against the risk of going too late.  If we go too soon, we can \u2014we had a lot of advice , you know, to go ahead and cut after the seven good months of last year.  We didn\u2019 t.  We said we needed to see\n\nJuly 31, 202 4   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nmore.  Then we saw some higher inflation.  We \u2019ve seen one quarter of good inflation, and we \u2019ve seen the labor market move quite a bit .  And, as I mentioned, I don\u2019 t think it needs to cool off anymore for us to get the inflation results that are related to the labor market\u2014not all inflation is , of course.  So I think it \u2019s a difficult judgment to make , and what you see is the judgment of the Committee is that that time is drawing near.  T hat time could be in September if , if the data support that. NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  And have the chances of  a hard landing increased? CHAIR POWELL.  So I, I don\u2019 t know whether they\u2019 ve increased .  I think they \u2019re low.  I think this is \u2014you don\u2019 t see any reason to think that this economy is either overheating or sharply weakening.  That\u2019s just not in the data right now.  What \u2019s in the data right now is an economy that\u2019s growing at a \u2014at a solid pace, a labor market that has cooled off, but , nonetheless, inflation \u2014sorry , unemployment is low .  The data overall show a strong labor market.  And so that\u2019s, that\u2019s  really what you see. It\u2019s not \u2014it\u2019s neither an overheating economy, nor is it a sharply weakening economy. It\u2019s, it\u2019s kind of what you would want to see, but , of course , the job is never done.  You know, we\u2019re, we\u2019re  watching to see, you know, which way the economy heads .  And I think we \u2019re\u2014if we are to respond to weakness, we \u2019re certainly , you know, well  equipped to do that .  But that \u2019s not what we \u2019re seeing.  What we\u2019 re seeing is strong economic activity and, you know, a good labor market and inflation coming down. MICHE LLE SMITH.  Greg. GREG ROBB.  Thank you so much.  In the \u2014in the  minutes of the June meeting that came out a few weeks ago, there was a discussion about communications, and some F ed officials said maybe the F ed wasn \u2019t as clear enough about its reaction function.  And , and when I talked to\n\nJuly 31, 202 4   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nthe commentators who bless you with their comments  [laughter], they say that they really don\u2019 t have a sense of what is going to judge, maybe not the first cut, but the pace of the cuts going forward .  They don\u2019 t have a good sense of that.  Is there anything you can say, like how will we judge that? CHAIR POWELL.  Yeah, I mean , I think the reality is that, that  forecasters\u2014and this isn\u2019t just the Fed by any means \u2014forecasters have been continually surprised by, for example, the strength of the economy last year.   So I think we had to be pretty humble about , about  giving forward guidance about this, that, and the other thing.  We need to be pretty careful about that . And, you know, when you\u2019 re saying you\u2019 re going to be data driven, of course , it\u2019s always what the data \u2014how they affect the outlook and the  balance of risks, but it \u2019s\u2014nobody has great vision deep into the future. In terms of a reaction function, that \u2019s a\u2014that\u2019s a long- time discussion that people have had forever.  I think people have understood for a long time , actually , that we were very focused on bringing down inflation.  N obody was really confused about that.  The data have, you know \u2014 again, we \u2019ve seen significant improvement in inflation just for the last quarter.  Markets move around on that \u2014on the data , really .  Not so much \u2014it\u2019 s not really what we \u2019re going to do.  I t\u2019s more just that the data keep coming in , and markets are very , very responsive to that data right now. MICHELLE SMITH.  Go to Jeff for the last question. JEFF COX.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I \u2019m going to change gears on you just a little bit from all of the rate talk and whatnot.   With FedNow being in the books for a little over a year, there hasn \u2019t been a whole lot of talk about central bank digital currency and wondering if you could give us an update on where things are with that.  Is that considered a  dead  issue now ?  Is it\n\nJuly 31, 202 4   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nstill something that \u2019s being discussed within the Committee , and what, what \u2019s happening with that? CHAIR POWELL.  It\u2019 s not something that comes up at all with the \u2014in the FOMC .  So, more broadly, digital finance is an area that \u2019s having\u2014that  has really significant implications for payments generally, instant payments.  And , you know, it\u2019 s something that\u2019 s going to really change the way \u2014it\u2019 s going to make more efficient and , hopefully, safer and all those things \u2014 the way payments are made around the world.  And so we have people who are researching that and trying to keep up to speed, because we play an important role in the payments sector, both as a convener and as an operator , too. In terms of a CBDC, there \u2019s really nothing new going on.  T here\u2019s not much going on at all.  We\u2019re not \u2014we don\u2019 t have the authority to issue a  CB\u2014a  retail CBDC that \u2019s available to the public.  We \u2019re not seeking that authority.  So what we \u2019re doing is keeping up with\u2014keeping up with developments there .  Pretty much every major central bank in the world is at least doing , doing that.  Some of them are actually seriously looking at implementing a CBDC .  We\u2019re really not.  We\u2019 re really just evaluating , you know, the story and what \u2019s happening out there.  So I think it \u2019s work that we need to be doing, which could be very beneficial down the road, but we don\u2019t have \u2014on a CBDC, we don\u2019 t have any plan to.  We would need to go to Congress , and we have no plan to do that .  We\u2019re not \u2014no one here has decided that we think it \u2019s a good idea yet. Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you."

    "text": "September 18, 2024 Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nTranscript of Chair Powell\u2019 s Press Conference September 18, 2024\n\nCHAIR POWELL.  Good afternoon.  My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on achieving our dual -mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of the American people.  Our economy is strong overall and has made significant progress toward our goals over the past two years.   The labor market has cooled from its formerly overheated state.   Inflation has eased substantially from a peak of 7\u202fpercent to an estimated 2.2\u202fpercent as of August.  We\u2019re committed to maintaining our economy \u2019s strength by supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to our 2\u202fpercent goal. Today , the Federal Open Market Committee decided to reduce the degree of policy restraint by lowering our policy interest rate by \u00bd\u202f percentage point.  This decision reflects our growing confidence that with an appropriate recalibration of our policy stance, strength in the labor market can be maintained in a context of moderate growth and inflation moving sustainably down to 2 percent.  We also decided to continue to reduce our securities holdings.  I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly revi ewing economic developments. Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace.   GDP rose at an annual rate of 2.2 percent in the first half of the year, and available data point to a roughly similar pace of growth this quarter.   Growth of consumer spending has remained resilient, and investment in equipment and intangibles has picked up from its anemic pace last year.   In the housing sector, investment fell back in the second quarter after rising strongly in the first.   Improving supply conditions have supported resilient demand and the strong performance of the U.S. economy over the past year.  In our Summary of Economic Projections, Committee participants generally expect GDP growth to remain solid, with a median projection of 2 percent over the next few years.\n\nSeptember 18, 2024 Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nIn the labor market, conditions have continued to cool.  Payroll job gains averaged 116,000 per month over the past three months, a notable step -down from the pace seen earlier in the year.  The unemployment rate has moved up but remains low at 4.2\u202fpercent.  Nominal wage growth has eased over the past year , and the jobs -to-workers gap has narrowed.  Overall, a broad set of indicators suggests that conditions in the labor market are now less tight than just before the pandemic in 2019.  The labor market is n ot a source of elevated inflationary pressures.   The median projection for the unemployment rate in the SEP is 4. 4 percent at the end of this year, four-tenths higher than projected in June. Inflation has eased notably over the past two years but remains above our longer -run goal of 2\u202fpercent.   Estimates based on the c onsumer p rice index and other data indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.2 percent over the 12 months ending in August and that, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.7 percent.  Longer -term inflation expectations appear to remain well  anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters as well as measur es from financial markets.   The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 2.3\u202fpercent this year and 2.1 percent next year, somewhat lower than projected in June. Thereafter, the median projection is 2 percent. Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.   For much of the past three years, inflation ran well above our 2\u202fpercent goal, and labor market conditions were extremely tight.   Our primary focus had been on bringing down inflation, and appropriately so.  We are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship , as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.\n\nSeptember 18, 2024 Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nOur restrictive monetary policy has helped restore the  balance between aggregate supply and demand, easing inflationary pressures and ensuring that inflation expectations remain well anchored.  Our patient approach over the past year has paid dividends:   Inflation is now much closer to our objective, and we have gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent. As inflation has declined and the labor market has cooled, the upside risks to inflation have diminished, and the downside risks to employment have increased.  We now see the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals as roughly in balance, and we are attentive to the risks to both sides of our dual mandate. In light of the progress on inflation and the balance of risks, at today \u2019s meeting , the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by \u00bd percentage point to 4\u00be percent to 5 percent.  This recalibration of our policy stance will help maintain the strength of the economy and the labor market and will continue to enable further progress on inflation as we begin the process of moving toward a more neutral stance.   We are not on any preset course.  We will continue to make our decision s meeting by meeting. We know that reducing policy restraint too quickly could hinder progress on inflation.  At the same time, reducing restraint too slowly could unduly weaken economic activity and employment.  In considering additional adjustments to the target range for the  federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. In our SEP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an appropriate path for the federal funds rate, based on what each participant judges to be the most likely scenario going forward.  If the economy evolves as expected, the median participant\n\nSeptember 18, 2024 Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nprojects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 4.4\u202fpercent at the end of this year and 3.4 percent at the end of 2025.  These median projections are lower than in June, consistent with the projections for lower inflation and higher unemployment, as well as the changed balance of risks.  These projections, however, are not a Committee plan or decision. As the economy evolves, monetary policy will adjust in order to best promote our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.  If the economy remains solid and inflation persists, we can dial back policy restraint more slowly.   If the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated, we are prepared to respond.  Policy is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandat e. The Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy\u2014 maximum employment and stable prices.   We remain committed to supporting maximum employment, bringing inflation back down to our 2\u202fpercent goal, and keeping longer -term inflation expectations well anchored. Our success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans.   We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country.   Everything we do is in service to our public mission.  We at the Fed will do everyt hing we can to achieve our maximum - employment and price -stability goals. Thank you.  I look forward to your questions. MICHELLE SMITH.  Steve. STEVE LIESMAN.  Steve Liesman, CNBC.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman , for taking our questions.  In July , you said you weren\u2019 t necessarily thinking about a 50.  Y ou didn\u2019 t want to be specific, but you said you weren\u2019 t thinking about a 50.  The inflation data last week came out a little firmer than expected .  Retail was strong, third -quarter GDP running 3 percent .  So what\n\nSeptember 18, 2024 Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nchanged that made the Committee go 50, and how do you respond to the concerns that perhaps it shows the F ed is more concerned about the labor market?  And I guess, should we expect more 50s in the months ahead?  And based on what should we make that call?  Thank you. CHAIR POWELL.  So, okay, a lot of questions in there.  [Laughter]  Let me jump in.  So, since the last meeting \u2014okay, the last meeting we have had a lot of data come in.  We\u2019ve had the two employment reports, July and August .  We\u2019ve also had two inflation reports, including one that came in during blackout .  We had the QCEW report, which suggests that maybe \u2014that not maybe, but suggests that the payroll report numbers that we \u2019re getting may be artificially high and will be revised down .  You know that.  We\u2019ve also seen anecdotal data, like [the data collected in] the Beige Book.  S o we took all of those , and we went into blackout .  And we thought about what to do, and we concluded that this was the right thing for the economy, for the people that we serve, and that \u2019s, that\u2019s  how we made our decision.  So that \u2019s one question.  What was the second and third? STEVE LIESMAN.  How do we make the \u2014sorry, thank you, sir.  How do we figure out in the months ahead, is there another 25 or 50 coming in based on what should we make that call?  Thank you. CHAIR POWELL.  Sure .  So a couple things .  A good place to start is the \u2014is the  SEP, but let me start with what I said, which was that we \u2019re going to be making decisions meeting by meeting based on the incoming data, the evolving outlook, the balance of risks.  If you look at the SEP, you\u2019 ll, you\u2019ll  see that it \u2019s, it\u2019s a process of recalibrating our policy stance away from where we had it a year ago, when inflation was high and unemployment low, to a place that \u2019s more appropriate given where we are now and w here we expect to be.  And that process will take place over time.  There \u2019s nothing in the \u2014in the  SEP that suggests the Committee is in a rush to\n\nSeptember 18, 2024 Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nget this done.  This, this  process evolves over time.   Of course , that \u2019s a projection .  That\u2019s a baseline projection.  We know, as I mentioned in my remarks, that the actual things that we do will depend on the way the economy evolves.  We can go quicker if that \u2019s appropriate .  We can go slower if that \u2019s appropriate.  We can pause if that \u2019s appropriate.  But that\u2019 s, that\u2019s  what we are contemplating.  A gain, I would point you to the SEP as just an assessment of where \u2014what the Committee is thinking today \u2014what the individual members , rather, of the Committee are thinking today , assuming that their particular forecasts take \u2014you know, are realized. MICHELLE SMITH.  Let \u2019s go to Chris. CHRIS RUGABER.  Hi .  Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.  Thank you.  The projections show that the F ed\u2014Fed  officials expect the fed funds rate to still be above their estimate of long -run neutral by the end of next year.  So does that suggest that you see  rates as restrictive for that entire period?  Does that threaten the weakening of the job market that you said you\u2019 d like to avoid?  Or does it suggest that maybe people see the short -run neutral as a little bit higher ?  Thank you. CHAIR POWELL.  I think it would \u2014the way I would really characterize it i s this :  I think people write down their estimate, individuals do.  I think every single person on the Committee, if you asked them , what \u2019s your level of certainty around that, they would say there \u2019s a wide range where that could fall.   So I think we don\u2019 t know .  There are model -based approaches and empirically based approaches that estimate what the neutral rate will be at any given time.  But, realistically, we know it by its works.  So that leaves us in a place where we\u2019 ll be\u2014where we expect , in the base case, to be continuing to remove restriction, and we \u2019ll be looking at the way the economy reacts to that .  And that \u2019ll be guiding us in our thinking about the question that we \u2019re asking at every meeting, which is , is our policy stance the appropriate one?\n\nSeptember 18, 2024 Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nWe know \u2014if you go back, we know that the policy stance we adopted in July of 2023 came at a time when unemployment was 3\u00bd percent and inflation was 4.2 percent.  Today , unemployment is up to 4.2 percent ; inflation \u2019s down to a few tenths above 2.  So we know that it is time to recalibrate our policy to something that is more appropriate given the progress on inflation and on employment moving to a more sustainable level .  So the balance of risks are now even.  And this is the beginning of that process I ment ioned, the direction of which is toward a sense of neutral, and we \u2019ll move as fast or as slow as we think is appropriate in real  time.  What you have is our individual \u2014accumulation of individual estimates of what that will be in the base case. MICHELLE SMITH.  Howard. HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Howard Schneider with Reuters.  How close was this in terms of the decision?  You do have the first dissent by a G overnor  since 2005, I think .  Was the weight clearly in favor of a 50, or was this a very close decision? CHAIR POWELL.  I think we had a good\u2014a good discussion .  You know, i f you go back, I talked about this at Jackson Hole, but I didn\u2019 t address the question of the size of the cut and left it open, and I think we left it open going into blackout .  And so there was a lot of discussion back and forth, good diversity of \u2014excellent discussion today.   I think there was also broad support for the decision that the Committee voted on.  So I would add, though, look at the SEP.  All 19 of the participants wrote down mul tiple cuts this year.  All 19.  That\u2019s a big change from June, right?  Seven of the \u2014seven of them wrote down three or more and\u2014sorry, 17 of the 19 wrote down three or more cuts , and 10 of the 19 wrote down four or more cuts.  So, you know, there is a dissent , and there \u2019s a range of views , but there \u2019s actually a lot of common ground as well.\n\nSeptember 18, 2024 Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Follow -up to that .  Now that this is in the books, can you give us some guidance as sort of  a follow -up to Steve on the pacing here?  Would you expect this to be running every other meeting once we get into next year? CHAIR POWELL.  We\u2019re going to take it meeting by meeting, as I mentioned.  T here\u2019s no sense that the Committee feels it \u2019s in a rush to do this.  We made a good, strong start to this , and that \u2019s really, frankly, a sign of our confidence \u2014confidence that inflation is , is coming down toward 2 percent on a sustainable basis.  That gives us the ability.  We can , you know, make a good, strong start.  But \u2014and I \u2019m very pleased that we did.  To me , the logic of this, both from an economic standpoint and also from a risk -management standpoint, was clear.   But I think we \u2019re going to go carefully , meeting by meeting, and make our decisions as we go. HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH.  Jeanna. JEANNA SMIALEK.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Jeanna Smialek, New York Times.   Thanks for taking our questions.  You and your colleagues in your economic projections today see the unemployment rate climbing to 4.4 percent and staying there.  Obviously, historically , when the unemployment rate climbs that much over a relatively short period of time, it doesn\u2019 t typically just stop \u2014it continues increasing.  And so I wonder if you can walk us through why you see the labor market stabilizing, sort of what\u2019 s the mechanism there?  And what do you see as the risks? CHAIR POWELL.  So, again, the labor market is actually in solid condition, a nd our intention with our policy move today is to keep it there.  You can say that about the whole economy.  The U.S. economy is in good shape.  It \u2019s growing at a solid pace, inflation is coming down, the labor market is in a strong pace, we want to keep it there.  That\u2019s, that\u2019s  what we \u2019re doing.\n\nSeptember 18, 2024 Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nMICHELLE  SMITH .  Sorry \u2014Nick. NICK TIMIRAOS.  Nick Timiraos  of the Wall Street Journal.  Chair Powell, does today\u2019 s action constitute a catch -up in action given recent substantial revisions to the employment data, or is this larger -than-typical rate cut a function of the elevated nominal level of the policy rate such that an accelerated cadence could be expected to continue? CHAIR POWELL.  Okay, multiple questions in there .  So I would say we don\u2019 t think we\u2019re behind .  We do not think\u2014we think this is timely, but I think you can take this as a sign of our commitment not to get behind.  So it\u2019s, it\u2019s a strong move.  Sorry, your other question was? NICK TIMIRAOS.  It was, is this about what happened in the employment data between this meeting and the last meeting?  Or is this about the level of the funds rate \u2014the high nominal level of funds rate relative to what might be expected if you \u2019re trying to maintain equilibrium? CHAIR POWELL.  So I think it \u2019s about \u2014we come into this with a policy position that was put in place, as you know, I mentioned, in July of 2023, which was a time of high inflation and very low unemployment.  We\u2019ve been very patient about , about  reducing the policy rate. We\u2019ve waited .  Other central banks around the world have cut, many of them several times. We\u2019ve waited , and I think that that patience has really paid dividends in the form of our confidence that inflation is moving sustainably under 2 perc ent.  So I think that is what enables us to take this , this  strong move today.  I do not think that anyone should look at this and say , \u201cOh, this is the new pace.\u201d   You know, you have to think about it in terms of the base case .  Of course , what happens will happen.  S o, so, in the base case, what you see is \u2014look at the SEP, you see cuts moving along.  T he sense of this is we\u2019 re recalibrating policy down over time to a more neutral level.  And we \u2019re moving at the pace that we think is appropriate given\n\nSeptember 18, 2024 Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\ndevelopments in the economy and the base case.  The economy can develop in a way that would cause us to go faster or slower, but that \u2019s what the base case is. NICK TIMIRAOS.  And, if I could follow  up on the  balance sheet , in 2019, when you did the mid -cycle adjustment, you ceased the balance sheet runoff.  With a larger cut today, is there any \u2014should there be any signal inferred about how the Committee would approach \u201c end state\u201d  on the balance sheet policy? CHAIR POWELL.  So, in the current situation, reserves have really been stable.  T hey haven\u2019 t come down.  So reserves are still abundant and expected to remain so for some time.   As you know, the shrinkage in our balance sheet has really come out of the overnight R RP [facility]. So I think what that tells you is , we\u2019re not thinking about , about  stopping runoff because of this at all.   We know that these two things can happen side by side .  In a sense, they\u2019 re both a form of normalization , and so, for a time , you can have the balance  sheet shrinking but also be cutting rates. MICHELLE SMITH.  Colby. COLBY SMITH.  Thank you.  Colby Smith with the Financial Times.   Just following up on Jeanna \u2019s question on rising unemployment .  Is it your view that this is just a function of a normalizing labor market amid improved supply, or is there anything to suggest that something more concerning perhaps is taking place here, given that other metrics of labor demand have softened too?  And I guess, in direct follow -up to Jeanna, do you not \u2014why should we not expect a further deterioration in labor market conditions if policy is still restrict ive? CHAIR POWELL.  So I think what we \u2019re seeing is, clearly labor market conditions have cooled off by any measure, as I talked about in Jackson Hole, and\u2014but they\u2019 re still at a level\u2014 the level of those conditions is actually pretty close to what I would call maximum employment.\n\nSeptember 18, 2024 Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL Page 11  of 26 So you\u2019 re close to mandate, maybe at mandate, on that.   So what \u2019s driving it?  Clearly, clearly payroll job creation has moved down over the last few months, and this bears watching.  Many \u2014 By many other measures, the labor market has returned to or below 2019 levels, which was a very good, strong labor market, but this is more sort of 2018, \u201917.  So the labor market bears close\u2014bears close watching , and we \u2019ll be giving it that.  But ultimately, we think \u2014we believe, with an appropriate recalibration of our policy , that we can continue to see the economy growing, and that will support the labor market.  In the meantime, if you look at the growth in economic activity data , retail sales data that we just got, second -quarter GDP \u2014all of this indicates an economy that is still growing at a solid pace.  So that should also support the labor market over time.   So\u2014but again, we \u2019re\u2014it bears watching .  And we \u2019re watching. COLBY SMITH.  And just on the point about starting to see rising layoffs, if that were to happen, wouldn\u2019 t the Committee already be too late in terms of avoiding a recession? CHAIR POWELL.  So we \u2019re\u2014that \u2019s\u2014you know, our plan, of course , has been to begin to recalibrate and  we\u2019re \u2014as you know, we \u2019re not seeing rising claims, we \u2019re not seeing rising layoffs, we \u2019re not seeing that , and we \u2019re not hearing that from companies that that \u2019s something that\u2019s getting ready to happen.  So we \u2019re not waiting for that, because , you know, there is \u2014there is thinking that the time to support the labor market is when \u2014is when  it\u2019s strong and not when we begin to see the layoffs.  There \u2019s some lore on that.  So that \u2019s the situation we \u2019re in.  We have, in fact, begun the cutting cycle now , and we \u2019ll be watching \u2014and that \u2019ll be one of the factors that we consider.  Of course , we\u2019re going to look at the totality of the data as we make these decisions meeting by meeting. MICHELLE SMITH.  Michael McKee.\n\nSeptember 18, 2024 Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nMICHAEL MCKEE.  Michael McKee with Bloomberg TV and Radio.  To follow  up on that, what would constitute for you and the Committee a deterioration in the labor market? You\u2019re pricing in, basically by the end of next year, 200 basis points of cuts just to maintain a higher unemployment rate.  Would you be moving to a more preemptive monetary policy style \u2014 rather than , as you did with inflation, waiting until the data gave you a signal? CHAIR POWELL.  We\u2019re going to be watching all of the data, right?   So if \u2014as I mentioned in my remarks, if the labor market were to slow unexpectedly, then we have the ability to react to that by , by cutting faster.  We\u2019re also going to be looking at our other mandate, though.  We are more\u2014 we have greater confidence now that inflation is moving down to 2 percent, but , at the same time, our plan is that we will be at 2 percent, you know, over time. So\u2014and policy , we think , is still restrictive , so that should still be happening. MICHAEL MCKEE.  I \u2019m just curious as to how sensitive you\u2019 ll be to the labor market, since you forecast we are going to see higher unemployment and it is going to take a significant amount of monetary easing to just maintain it. CHAIR POWELL.  So, you know, what I would say is , we don\u2019 t think we need to see further loosening in labor market conditions to get inflation down to 2 percent.  But we have a dual mandate, and I think you can take this whole action as \u2014take a step back, what have we been trying to achieve?  We\u2019re trying to achieve a situation where we restore price stability without the kind of painful increase in unemployment that has come sometimes with disinflation. That\u2019s what we \u2019re trying to do.  And I think you can t ake today\u2019 s action as a sign of our strong commitment to achieve that goal. MICHELLE SMITH.  Rachel.\n\nSeptember 18, 2024 Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nRACHEL SIEGEL.  Hi , Chair Powell .  Rachel S iegel from the Washington Post.  Thanks for taking our questions.  You\u2019re describing this view that you don\u2019 t think you\u2019 re behind when it comes to the job market.  Can you walk us through the specific data points that you found to be most helpful in the discussions at this meeting?   You\u2019ve mentioned a couple , but would you be able to walk us through what that dashboard told you, as far as what you know about the job market now? CHAIR POWELL.  Sure .  So we \u2019ll start with unemployment, which is the single most important one probably .  You\u2019re at 4.2 percent.  That\u2019s, you know \u2014I know it \u2019s higher than we were used to seeing , numbers in the mid - and even below mid- 3s last year, but , if you look back over the sweep of the year s, that \u2019s, that\u2019s  a low .  That\u2019s a very healthy unemployment rate.  And anything in the low 4s  is, is a really \u2014is a good labor market.  So that \u2019s one thing.  Participation is at high levels .  It\u2019s, you know \u2014we \u2019ve had \u2014we \u2019re right\u2014adjusted for demographics for aging, participation \u2019s at pretty high levels .  That\u2019s a good thing.  Wages are still a bit above what would be their \u2014wage increases, rather , are still just a bit above where they would be over the very longer  term to be consistent with 2 percent inflation, but they \u2019re very much coming down to what that sustainable level is.  So we feel good about that.  Vacancies over \u2014per unemployed is back to what is still a very strong level .  It\u2019s not as high as it was.  That number reached two  to one, two vacancies for every unemployed person.  A s measured, it \u2019s now below \u2014it\u2019s around one.  But that \u2019s still\u2014that \u2019s still a very good number, I would say.  You know, quits have come back down to normal levels .  I mean , I could go on and on.  There are many, many employment indicators .  What do they say?  They say this is still a solid labor market.  The question isn\u2019 t the level ; the question is that there has been change, particularly over the last few months , and, you know, so what we say is, as the risks, the upside risks, to inflation have really come down, the\n\nSeptember 18, 2024 Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\ndownside risks to employment have increased .  And, and because we have been patient and held our fire on cutting while , while inflation has come down, I think we \u2019re now in a very good position to manage the risks to both of our goals. RACHEL SIEGEL.  And what do you expect to learn between now and November that will help inform the scale of the cut at the next meeting? CHAIR POWELL.  You know, m ore data, the usual.  Don \u2019t look for anything else.  We\u2019ll see another labor report .  We\u2019ll see another jobs report .  I think we get a \u2014we might, actually \u2014 we get two \u2014we get a second jobs report on the day of the meeting, I think , or no, no, on the Friday before the meeting.   So\u2014and inflation data .  We\u2019ll get all this data .  We\u2019ll be watching . You know, it\u2019 s always a question of , look at the incoming data and ask what are the implications of that data for the evolving outlook and the balance of risks and then go through our process and think, what \u2019s the right thing to do?  Is policy where we want it to  be to foster the achievement of our goals over time?   So that \u2019s what it is , and that \u2019s what we \u2019ll be doing. MICHELLE SMITH.  Neil. NEIL IRWIN.  Thanks.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Neil Irwin with Axios.  We\u2019ve only been running a little above 100,000 jobs a month on payroll the last three months.  Do you view that level of job creation as worrying or alarming, or would you be \u2014would you be  content if we were to kind of stick at that level?  And relatedly, you know, one of the welcome trends of the last couple of years has been labor markets seen coming out through job openings falling, rather than job losses.  Do you think that trend has further to run, or do you see risk that further labor market cooling will have to come through job losses? CHAIR POWELL.  So , on the job creation, it depends on\u2014it depends on the inflows, right?  So , if you\u2019 re having millions of people come into the labor force then, and you\u2019 re creating\n\nSeptember 18, 2024 Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\n100,000 jobs, you\u2019 re going to see unemployment go up.  So it really depends on what \u2019s the trend underlying the volatility of people coming into the country.  We understand there \u2019s been quite an influx across the borders, and that has actually been one of the things that \u2019s, that\u2019s, that\u2019s  allowed the unemployment rate to rise .  And the other thing is just the slower hiring rate , which is something we also watch carefully.  So it does depend on what \u2019s happening on the supply side. On the  Beveridge c urve question, yes, so we all felt, on the Committee, not all , but I think everyone on the Committee felt that job openings were so elevated that they could fall a long way before you hit the part of the curve where job openings turned into higher unemployment, job loss.  And yes, I mean, I think we are \u2014it\u2019s hard to know that \u2014you can\u2019 t know these things with great precision, but certainly it appears that we \u2019re very close to that point, if not at it , so that further declines in job openings  will translate more directly into unemployment.  But it\u2019 s been \u2014 it\u2019s been a great ride down .  I mean , we\u2019ve seen a lot of , of tightness come out of the labor market in that form without it resulting in lower employment. MICHELLE SMITH.  Edward. EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Thanks , Chair Powell .  Edward Lawrence with  Fox Business. So we \u2019ve heard some speculation that you may be going with the federal funds rate to 3\u00bd, maybe under 4 percent .  There\u2019s basically an entire generation that has experienced zero or near - zero federal funds rate, and some think we \u2019re heading in that direction again.  What\u2019s the likelihood that cheap money is now the norm? CHAIR POWELL.  So this is a question \u2014and you mean after we get through all of this? It\u2019s just \u2014great question that we just, we can only speculate about.  Intuitively , most \u2014many, many people anyway, would say we \u2019re probably not going back to that era where there were trillions of dollars of sovereign bonds trading at negative rates \u2014long- term bonds trading at\n\nSeptember 18, 2024 Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nnegative rates.   And it looked like the neutral rate was\u2014might even be negative, so \u2014and it was\u2014people were issuing debt at negative rates.   It seems that \u2019s so far away now .  My own sense is that we \u2019re not going back to that.  But, you know, honestly, we \u2019re going to find out.  But , you know, it feels \u2014it feels to me that the neutral rate is probably significantly higher than it was back then.  How high is it?   I don\u2019 t\u2014I just don\u2019 t think we know.  It\u2019 s\u2014again, we only know it by its works. EDWARD LAWRENCE.  And one more, how do you respond to the criticism that will likely come that a deeper rate cut now, before the election, has some political motivations? CHAIR POWELL.  Yeah, so , you know, this is my fourth presidential election at the F ed, and, you know, it\u2019 s always the same.  We\u2019re always \u2014we\u2019re always going into this meeting, in particular , and asking, what \u2019s the right thing to do for the people we serve?  And we do that , and we make a decision as a group , and then we announce it.  And it \u2019s\u2014that\u2019s always what it is.  I t\u2019s never about anything else.  Nothing else is discussed , and I would also point out that the things that we do really affect economic conditions for the most part with a lag .  So, nonetheless, this is what we do.  Our job is to support the economy on behalf of the American people.  And, if we get it right, this will benefit the American people significantly.  So this really concentrates the mind , and, you know, it\u2019 s something we all take very, very seriously.  We don\u2019 t put up any other filters.  I think if you start doing that, I don\u2019 t know where you stop.  And so we just don\u2019 t do that. MICHELLE SMITH. Jo Ling. JO LING KENT.  Thank you, Chair Powell .  I\u2019m Jo Ling Kent with CBS News.   My first question is , very simply, what message are you trying to send American consumers, the American people, with this unusually large rate cut?\n\nSeptember 18, 2024 Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nCHAIR POWELL.   I would just say that , you know, the U.S. economy is in a good place, and, and our decision today is designed to keep it there.  More specifically, the economy is growing at a solid pace, inflation is coming down closer to our 2 percent objective over time, and the labor market is still in solid shape .  So our intention is really to maintain the strength that we currently see in the U.S. economy.  And we \u2019ll do that by returning rates from their high level, which has really been\u2014the purpose of  which has been to get inflation under control.  We\u2019re, we\u2019re  going to move those down over time to a more normal level over time. JO LING KENT.  Just have a follow -up to that .  Listening to you talk about inflation moving meaningfully down to 2 percent, is the Federal Reserve effectively declaring a decisive victory over inflation and rising prices? CHAIR POWELL.  No , we\u2019re not.  So inflation, you know \u2014what we say is we want inflation \u2014the goal is to have inflation move down to 2 percent on a sustainable basis.   And, you know, we \u2019re not really \u2014we\u2019re close, but we \u2019re not really at 2 percent.  A nd I think we \u2019re going to want to see it be , you know, around 2 percent and close to 2 percent for some time, but we \u2019re certainly not doing\u2014we \u2019re not saying \u201c mission accomplished \u201d or anything like that.   But I have to say , though, we \u2019re encouraged by the progress that we have made. MICHELLE SMITH.  Catarina. CATARINA SARAIV A.   Hi.  Catarina Saraiva with Bloomberg News.  I just would love to know kind of how the Committee is thinking about the persistence we \u2019ve seen in housing inflation.   You know, do you think you can return to 2 percent with housing inflation where it is? Yeah. CHAIR POWELL.  So housing inflation is the \u2014is the one piece that is kind of dragging a bit, if I can say.  We know that market rents are doing what we would want them to do, which\n\nSeptember 18, 2024 Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nis to be moving up at relatively low levels, but they\u2019 re not rolling over \u2014the leases that are rolling over are not coming down as much and OER is coming in high.  S o, you know, it\u2019 s been slower than we expected.  I think we now understand that it \u2019s going to take some time for those lower market rents to get into this.  But , you know, the direction of travel is clear, and as long as market rents remain , you know, relatively low inflation, over time that will show up, just the time it\u2019s taking now , several years rather than just one or two cycles of annual lease renewals.  So that\u2019s\u2014I think we understand that now, but I don\u2019 t think the outcome is in doubt again .  As long as market rent s remain under control, the outcome is not as in doubt.  So I would say it \u2019s\u2014the rest of the portfolio \u2014or of the elements that go into core PCE inflation have behaved pretty well. You know, t hey\u2019re all\u2014they all have some volatility.  We will get down to 2 percent inflation, I believe, and I believe that , ultimately , we\u2019ll get what we need to get out of the housing services piece, too. CATARINA SARAIV A.   Some of your colleagues have expressed concern that , with starting to cut rates , you could re -ignite demand in housing and see prices go up even more. What \u2019s the likelihood of that , and how would you react to that? CHAIR POWELL.  The housing market, it \u2019s hard to\u2014it \u2019s a game that \u2014the housing market is in part frozen because of lock -in with low rates .  People don\u2019 t want to sell their home s. So, because they have a very low mortgage, it would be quite expensive to refinance.  As rates come down, people will start to move more , and that \u2019s probably beginning to happen already. But remember, when that happens , you \u2019ve got a seller , but you\u2019 ve also got a new buyer in many cases.  So it \u2019s not , you know, obvious  how much addi tional demand that would make.  I mean , the real issue with housing is that we have had, and are on track to continue to have, not enough housing.  And so it \u2019s going to be challenging.  It \u2019s hard to find \u2014to zone lots that are in places\n\nSeptember 18, 2024 Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nwhere people want to live .  It\u2019s\u2014all of the aspects of housing are more and more difficult, and , you know, where are we going to get the supply?  And this is not something that the Fed can , can really fix.  But I think , as we normalize rates, you \u2019ll see the housing market normalize .  And, I mean , ultimately by getting inflation broadly down and getting those rates normalized and getting the housing cycle normalized, that \u2019s the best thing we can do for house holders .  And then the supply question will have t o be dealt with by the market and also by government. MICHELLE SMITH.  Victoria. VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi.  Victoria Guida with Politico.  Just following up on some of the labor market talk earlier, you know, monetary policy operates with long and variable lags, and I\u2019m wondering how much you see being able to keep the unemployment rate from raising too much comes from the fact that you\u2019 re starting to act now and that \u2019s going to give people more room to run versus just the labor market is strong.   And then, also, if I could, following up on Nick \u2019s question, do you see today \u2019s 50 basis point move as partially a response to the fact that you didn\u2019 t cut in July and that sort of gets you to the same place? CHAIR POWELL.  So you\u2019 re right about lags, but I would just point to the overall economy.  You have an economy that is growing at a solid pace .  If you look at forecasters or talk to companies, they\u2019 ll say that they think 2025 should be a good year , too.  So there \u2019s no sense\u2014the U.S. economy is basically fine if you talk to market participants, I mean, you know, business people who are actually out there doing business.  So  I think, you know, I think our move is timely .  I do.  And, as I said, you can \u2014you can see our , our 50 basis point move as a commitment to make sure that we don \u2019t fall behind. So you\u2019 re really asking about \u2014your second question, you\u2019 re asking about July.  And I guess if you ask if we \u2019d gotten the July report before the meeting, would we have cut?   We might\n\nSeptember 18, 2024 Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nwell have.  We didn\u2019 t make that decision , but we might well have.   I think that \u2019s not \u2014you know, that doesn\u2019 t really answer the question that we ask ourselves, which is , let\u2019s look, you know \u2014at this meeting we\u2019 re looking back to the July employment report, the August employment report, the two CPI reports, one of which came , of course , during blackout, and all of the other things that I mentioned .  We\u2019re looking at all of those things , and we \u2019re asking oursel ves, what \u2019s the right \u2014what \u2019s the policy stance we need to move to ?  We knew \u2014it\u2019s clear that we \u2014clearly, literally, everyone on the Committee agreed that it\u2019 s time to move.   It\u2019s just how big\u2014how fast do you go, and what do you think about the paths  forward.  So this decision we made today had broad support on the Committee, and I \u2019ve discussed the path ahead. MICHELLE SMITH.  Elizabeth. ELIZABETH SCHULZE.  Thank you, Chair Powell.  Elizabeth Schulze with ABC News.  Mortgage rates have already been dropping in anticipation of this announcement .  How much more should borrowers expect those rates to drop over the next year? CHAIR POWELL.  Very hard for me to say.  That\u2019s\u2014from our standpoint, I can \u2019t really speak to mortgage rates.  I will say that\u2019 ll depend on how the economy evolves.  Our intention , though, is \u2014we think that our policy was appropriately restrictive .  We think that it \u2019s time to begin the process of recalibrating it to a level that\u2019 s more neutral, rather than restrictive.  We expect that process to take some time, as you can see in the projections that we released today. And as \u2014if things work out according to that forecast, other rates in the economy will come down as well.  However, the rate at which those things happen will really depend on how the economy performs.  We can \u2019t see\u2014we can \u2019t look a year ahead and know what the economy is to be doing\u2014going to be doing.\n\nSeptember 18, 2024 Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nELIZABETH SCHULZE.   What \u2019s your message to households who are frustrated that home prices have still stayed so high as rates have been high?  What do you say to those households? CHAIR POWELL.  Well, what I can say to the public is that we had the highest \u2014we had a burst of inflation .  Many other countries around the world had a similar burst of inflation, and, when that happens , part of the answer is that we raise interest rates in order to cool the economy off in order to reduce inflationary pressures.  It\u2019s not something that people experience as pleasant, but , at the end , what you get is low inflation restored, price stability restored .  And a good definition of price stability i s that people in their daily decisions, they\u2019 re not thinking about inflation anymore.   That\u2019s where everyone wants to be , is back to what \u2019s inflation, you know? Just keep it low , keep it stable.  We\u2019re restoring that.  S o what we \u2019re going through now really restores\u2014it will benefit people over a long period of time.  Price stability benefits everybody over a long period of time , just by virtue of the fact that they don \u2019t have to deal with inflation. So that \u2019s what \u2019s been going on, and I think we \u2019ve made real progress.  I completely \u2014we don\u2019 t tell people how to think about the economy, of course .  And, of course , people are  [still] experiencing high prices , as opposed to high inflation.  And we understand that \u2019s painful. MICHELLE SMITH.  Greg. GREG ROBB.   Hi, Chair Powell.  Greg Robb from Marketwatch.com.  I was wondering if you could go through \u2014you said just at the beginning that , coming into the blackout , there was like an open thought of 25 or 50\u2014you know, the F ed could move either 25 or 50.  I would sort of argue that when we had those two last speeches by Governor Waller and New York F ed President John Williams, that they were sort of saying that maybe a gradual approach was going to win the day.  I mean , I sort of want to ask a seven -part question about this.  But, I mean, could you talk\u2014\n\nSeptember 18, 2024 Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nwould you have cut rates by 50 basis points if the market had been pricing in, like , low odds of a 50 point move like they were last Wednesday , you know, a fter the CPI number came out?   It was a really small probability of a 50 point cut.  D oes that play in your consideration at all?   Just talk a little bit about that.  Thank you. CHAIR POWELL.   We\u2019re always going to try to do what we think is the right thing for the economy at that time.  That\u2019s what we\u2019 ll do.  And that \u2019s what we did today. MICHELLE SMITH.  Simon. SIMON RABINOVITCH.  Thank you, Chair Powell.  Simon Rabinovitch with the Economist.  You\u2019ve mentioned how closely you\u2019 re watching the labor market, but you also noted that payroll numbers have been a little bit less reliable lately because of the big downward revisions.  Does that put your focus overwhelmingly on the unemployment rate?  And given the SEP projection of 4.4 [percent] basically being the peak in the cycle, would going above that be the kind of thing that would trigger another 50 basis point cut? CHAIR POWELL.  So we will continue to look at that broad array of labor market data, including the payroll numbers.  We\u2019re not discarding those.  I mean , we\u2019ll certainly look at those, but we will mentally tend to adjust them based on the QCEW adjustment, which you referred to.  There isn \u2019t a bright line .  You know, it will be \u2014the unemployment rate \u2019s very important, of course, but there isn\u2019 t a single statistic or single bright line over which that thing that might move that would dictate one thing or another.  We\u2019ll look at\u2014each meeting , we\u2019ll look at all the data on inflation, economic activity, and the labor market , and we \u2019ll make decisions about , is our policy stance where it needs to be to foster over the medium term our mandate goals ?  So I can\u2019t\u2014I can\u2019t  say we have a bright line in mind. MICHELLE SMITH.  Matt Egan.\n\nSeptember 18, 2024 Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nMATT EGAN.  Thanks , Chair Powell.  Matt Egan from CNN.  I know that you discussed earlier  how the F ed does whatever the right thing is and nothing else factors in.  But , in general, can you talk about whether or not you believe a sitting U.S. president should have a say in F ed decisions on interest rates?  Because that \u2019s something that former P resident Trump, who obviously appointed you, has previously suggested.  And I know the F ed is designed to be independent , but why?  Can you tell the public why you view that as so important? CHAIR POWELL.  Sure .  So countries that are \u2014democracies around the world, countries that are sort of like the United States, all have what are called independent central banks.  And the reason is that people have found over time that insulating the central bank from direct control by political authorities avoids making monetary policy in a way that favors maybe people who are in office as opposed to people who are not in office.  So that \u2019s the idea, is that \u2014 you know, I think the data are clear that countrie s that have independent central banks, they get lower inflation .  And so we \u2019re, we \u2019re not \u2014we do our work to serve all Americans .  We\u2019re not serving any politician, any political figure, any cause, any issue, nothing.  It\u2019s just maximum employment and price stability on behalf of all Americans.  And that \u2019s how the other central banks are set up, too.  It \u2019s a good institutional arrangement, which has been good for the public and I hope \u2014and I hope and strongly believe that it will continue. MICHELLE SMITH.  Kyle. KYLE CAMPBELL.   Kyle Campbell for American Banker.   Thanks for taking the questions, Chair Powell.  A couple regulatory developments in the past week that I want to ask you about.  First, last week Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr outlined his views for the changes to the Base l III endgame.   I\u2019m wondering if you are in alignment with him on what those changes should be, if those have support on the B oard in the broad way that you\u2019 re looking\n\nSeptember 18, 2024 Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nfor, and if you think the other agencies are also fully onboard with that approach.  And then yesterday, other banking regulators \u2014 CHAIR POWELL.  You know what, hold the second question. KYLE CAMPBELL.  Okay .  Sure. CHAIR POWELL.  We\u2019ll give you the second question.  So the answer to your question is that, yes, those , those  changes were negotiated between the agencies with my support and with my involvement, with the idea that we were going to re -propose, re -propose the changes that Vice Chair Barr talked about and then take comment on them.  So, yes, that is \u2014that \u2019s happening with my support. KYLE CAMPBELL.  Is there a date for that \u2014 CHAIR POWELL.  That\u2019s not a final proposal , though, you understand.  W e\u2019re putting them out for comment.  W e\u2019re going to take comment and make appropriate changes.  We don\u2019 t have a \u2014we don\u2019t have a calendar date for that , and , as for the other agencies, you know, the idea is that we \u2019re all moving together , we\u2019re not moving separately, so that \u2014I don \u2019t know exactly where that is.  But the idea is that we will move as a group to put this , again , out for comment, and then, you know, it\u2019 ll\u2014the comments will come back 60 days later , and we \u2019ll dive into them, and we \u2019ll try to bring this to a conclusion sometime in the first half of next year. KYLE CAMPBELL.  Right.  And then, yesterday . there were merger reform finalizations from the other bank regulators .  What does the F ed have to do to align itself on a merger ? CHAIR POWELL.  You know, I would\u2014I would bounce that question to Vice Chair Barr.  It \u2019s a good question, but I don \u2019t have that today.  Thanks. MICHELLE SMITH.  Jennifer , for the last question.\n\nSeptember 18, 2024 Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER.  Thank you, Chair Powell.  Jennifer Schonberger with Yahoo Finance.  You said earlier that the decision today reflects with appropriate recalibration strength in the labor market that could be maintained in the context of moderate growth, even though the policy statement says you view the risks to inflation and job growth as roughly balanced.   Given what you\u2019 ve said , though, today, I \u2019m curious, are you more worried about the job market and growth than inflation?  Are they not roughly balanced? CHAIR POWELL.  No, I think\u2014 I think, and we think, they are now roughly balanced. So if you go back for a long time, the risks were on inflation.  W e had  a historically tight labor market, historically tight.  There was a severe labor shortage , so very hot labor market .  And we had inflation way above target.  So, you know, that said to us, concentrate on inflation, concentrate on inflation.  And we did for a while , and we kept at that, that the stance that we put in place 14 months ago was a stance that wa s focused on bringing down inflation.  Part of bringing down inflation,  though, is cooling off the economy and a little bit cooling off the labor market.  You now have a cooler labor market, in part because of our activity.  So what that tells you is , it\u2019s time to change our stance.   So we did that.  The sense of the change in the stance is that we \u2019re recalibrating our policy over time to a stance that will be more neutral.  And today was\u2014I think we made a good strong start on that.  I think it was the right decision, and I  think it should send a signal that we , you know, that  we\u2019re committed to coming up with a good outcome here. JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.  Is the economy more vulnerable to a shock now that could tip it into recession? CHAIR POWELL.  I don\u2019 t think so.  I don\u2019 t\u2014there \u2019s\u2014as I look\u2014well, let me look at it this way :  I don\u2019t see anything in the economy right now that suggests that the likelihood of a\n\nSeptember 18, 2024 Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference  FINAL\n\nrecession \u2014sorry, of a downturn is elevated, okay?  I don\u2019 t see that.  You see\u2014you see growth at a solid rate, you see inflation coming down, and you see a labor market that \u2019s, that\u2019s  still at very solid levels.  So, so I don\u2019 t really see that, no.  Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH .  Thank you."

My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on achieving our dual -mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of the American people.  The economy is strong overall and has made significant progress toward our goals over the past two years.  The labor market has cooled from its formerly overheat ed state and remains solid.  Inflation has eased substantially from a peak of 7\u202fpercent to 2.1\u202fpercent as of September.  We are committed to maintaining our economy\u2019s strength by supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to our 2\u202fpercent goal. Today, the FOMC  decided to take another step in reducing the degree of policy restraint by lowering our policy interest rate by \u00bc\u202fpercentage point.  We continue to be confident that , with an appropriate recalibration of our policy stance, strength in the economy and the labor market can be maintained, with inflation moving sustainably down to 2 percent.  We also decided to continue to reduce our securities holdings.  I \u2019ll have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments. Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. GDP rose at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in the third quarter, about the same pace as in the second quarter.  Growth of consumer spending has remained resilient, and investment in equipment and intangibles has strengthened.  In contrast, activity in the housing sector has been weak.  Overall, improving supply conditions have supported the strong performance of the U.S. economy over the past year. In the labor market, conditions remain solid.  Payroll job gains have slowed from earlier in the year, averaging 104,000 per month over the past three months.  This figure would have been somewhat higher were it not for the effects of labor strikes and hurricanes on employment\n\nNovember  7, 2024   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nin October.  Regarding the hurricanes, let me extend our sympathies to all the families, businesses, and communities who have been harm \u2014harmed by these devastating storms. The unemployment rate is notably higher than it was a year ago but has edged down over the past three months and remains low at 4.1 percent in October.  Nominal wage growth has eased over the past year, and the jobs -to-workers gap has narrowed.  Overall, a  broad set of indicators suggests that conditions in the labor market are now less tight than just before the pandemic in 2019.  The labor market is not a source of significant inflationary pressures. Inflation has eased significantly over the past two years.  Total PCE prices rose 2.1 percent over the 12 months ending in September; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.7 percent.  Overall, inflation has moved much closer to our 2 percent longer -run goal, but core inflation remains somewhat elevated.  Longer -term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets. Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.  We see the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals as being roughly in balance, and we \u2019re attentive to the risks to both sides of our mandate.  At today\u2019s meeting , the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by \u00bc percentage point, to 4\u00bd percent to 4\u00be\u202fpercent.  This further recalibration of our policy stance will help maintain the strength of the economy and the labor market and will continue to enable further progress on inflation as we move toward a more neutral stance over time. We know that reducing policy strain \u2014restraint too quickly could hinder progress on inflation.  At the same time, reducing policy restraint too slowly could unduly weaken economic\n\nNovember  7, 2024   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nactivity and employment.  In considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.  We are not on any preset course.  We will co ntinue to make our decisions meeting by meeting. As the economy evolves, monetary policy will adjust in order to best promote our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.  If the economy remains strong and inflation is not sustainably moving toward 2 percent, we can dial back policy restraint more slowly.  If the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipate d, we can move more quickly.  Policy is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual m andate. The Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy\u2014 maximum employment and stable prices.  We remain committed to supporting maximum employment, bringing inflation sustainably to our 2\u202fpercent goal, and keeping longer -term inflation expectations well a nchored. Our success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans.  We understand that our affect \u2014actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country.  Everything we do is in service to our public mission.  We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.  Thank you.  I look forward to our discussion. MICHELLE SMITH .  Colby. COLBY SMITH.  Thank you.  Given the expectation that the election outcome will produce policies that would meaningfully impact the U .S. economy next year, how is the Committee taking these proposals into account for upcoming decisions, including potentially the next one in December ?  And, and can you give us any more sense of how proactive or reactive the Fed is prepared to be to changes in economic policies with the next A dministration?\n\nNovember  7, 2024   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nCHAIR POWELL.  Sure.  So let me say that in the near term, the election will have no effects on our policy decisions.  As you know, many, many things affect the economy, and anyone who writes down forecasts in their job will tell you that the economy is quite difficult to forecast , looking out past the very near term.  Here , we don\u2019 t know what the timing and substance of any policy changes will be.  We therefore don\u2019 t know what the effects on the economy would be \u2014specifically, whether and to what extent those policies would matter for the achievement of our goal variables :  maximum employment and price stability.  We don \u2019t\u2014we don\u2019t  guess, we don\u2019 t speculate, and we don\u2019 t assume.  Now, just in principle, it \u2019s possible that any A dministration \u2019s policies or , or policies put in place by Congress could have economic effects over time \u2014over time  that would matter for our pursuit of our dual- mandate goals.  So , we\u2014along with countless other factors, forecast s of those economic effects would be included in our models of the economy and would be taken into account through that channel. MICHELLE SMITH.  Nick. NICK TIMIRAOS.  Chair Powell, Nick Timiraos from the Wall Street Journal.  Roughly one year ago when the 10- year Treasury was flirting with 5 percent and 30 -year mortgage rates were near 8 percent, you noted how higher borrowing costs , if they were sustained , could weigh on economic activity.  Given that you\u2019 ve said you believe policy is restrictive and the Fed is now dialing back that restriction, are the growth risks presented by higher U .S. Treasury yields today any different from those you identified one year ago when inflation was still meaningfully above your target? CHAIR POWELL.  So I would just say this .  We\u2019ve watched the , the run-up in bond rates, and it \u2019s, it\u2019s nowhere where it was, of course, a year ago.  I guess th at, you know, the long-\n\nNovember  7, 2024   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nrun rates are well below that level.  So we \u2019re watching tha t.  Things have been moving around, and we \u2019ll see where they settle.  I think it \u2019s too early to really say where they settle. Ultimately , I\u2019m sure we\u2019 ve all read these decompositions of what, you know \u2014and I certainly have, but it \u2019s not really our job to provide our specific decomposition.  I will say, though, that it appears that the moves are not , not principally about higher inflation expectations . They\u2019re really about a sense of more likely  to have stronger growth and perhaps less in the way of downside risks.  So that \u2019s what they\u2019 re about. You know, we do take financial conditions into account.  If they \u2014if they\u2019re persistent and if they\u2019 re material, then we\u2019 ll certainly take them into account in our policy.  But I would say we\u2019re not at \u2014we\u2019re not at  that stage right now .  It\u2019s just something that we \u2019re watching.  And , again, these things don\u2019 t really have mainly to do  with , with  Fed policy, but to do with other factors in the economy. NICK TIMIRAOS.  If I could follow up \u2014is the September SEP \u2014are those rate projections still valid ?  Do they still seem relevant given where we are now? CHAIR POWELL.  You know what ?  It\u2019s\u2014you get halfway through the cycle between the last set and the next set.  I , I wouldn\u2019 t want to comment one way or the other.  You know, people are \u2014let \u2019s talk about the data we \u2019ve gotten since the last meeting. So, in the main , the economic activity data have been stronger than expected.  The NIPA revision was stronger.  Certainly , the September employment report was stronger ; the October report , not stronger ; retail sales, stronger.  So , overall, though, I think you take away a sense of , of some of the downside risks to economic activity having, having been diminished , with the NIPA revisions in particular, and so,  overall , feeling , feeling  good about economic activity.  So I think we would factor that in.\n\nNovember  7, 2024   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nAt the same time, we got one inflation report , which was \u2014it wasn \u2019t terrible, but it was \u2014 it was  a little higher than expected.  So I think, really , the question is, is December .  And, you know, by December we \u2019ll have \u2014we\u2019ll have  more data:   I guess one more employment report, two more inflation reports, and lots of other data , and, you know, we\u2019ll make a decision as we get to December. MICHELLE SMITH.  Jeanna. JEANNA SMIALEK.  Jeanna Smialek from the New York Times.   Thanks for taking our questions, Chair Powell.  When it comes to December, what will you be looking at specifically as you try to make that decision?  And then, as of the Fed \u2019s economic projections in September , you, you had written down fo ur quarter -point interest rate cuts in 2025 .  Do you still think that those are likely?  Is that sort of the baseline outlook at this point, or has that shifted?  And if it shifted at all, can you\u2014can you give a little bit of , of detail as to why? CHAIR POWELL.  You know, I can\u2019 t.  We don \u2019t fill out a\u2014we don\u2019t fill out  an SEP, and I can \u2019t characterize one that wasn \u2019t filled out today.  So  I can \u2019t really speak for kind of exactly where the\u2014where the  Committee is.  I would just say, for December , we\u2019re going to be\u2014again, in every meeting\u2014we \u2019re going to be looking at the incoming data and how that affects the outlook. As you know, we \u2019re in the process of recalibrating from a fairly restrictive level at 5.33 percent .  After today \u2019s move , we\u2019re down 75 basis points.  And we \u2019re, we\u2019re  asking ourselves, \u201c Is that where we need to be?\u201d   You know that we \u2019re, we\u2019re  trying to steer between the risk of moving too quickly and perhaps undermining our progress on inflation or moving too slowly and allowing the labor market to weaken too much.  We \u2019re trying to , to be on a middle path where we can maintain the strength in the labor market while also enabling further progress\n\nNovember  7, 2024   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\non inflation.  We think that \u2019s where we are, but that \u2019s the question we \u2019re going to be asking in September and, and in other meetings.  And , again, I can \u2019t really update you on the C ommittee \u2019s thinking, because we don\u2019 t fill out an SEP at this meeting. JEANNA SMIALEK.  Yes, total\u2014totally appreciate that.  I guess when it comes to your own thinking, do you think that  that\u2014a full percentage point of rate cuts in 2025\u2014is a reasonable outlook? CHAIR POWELL.  Again, I \u2019m going to wait \u2014we\u2019re going to wait and see how things come in in December.  I mean, I \u2014it\u2019s just \u2014I would put it this way:   We\u2019re on a path to a more neutral stance.  And , and that \u2019s very much what we \u2019re on.  That has not changed at all since September.  And, you know, we \u2019re just going to have to see where the \u2014where the data lead us. We have, you know, a whole six weeks of data to look at to make that decision in December. Obviously, I \u2019m not ruling it out or in, but , but, you know, I would say\u2014you know, I would say that, you know, again, we didn\u2019 t update the SEP, so I \u2019m not going to characterize, you know, where the C ommittee would be. MICHELLE SMITH.  Howard.  HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Thanks.  Howard Schneider with Reuters.  I wondered if you could please elaborate and explain a little bit the two changes in the language of the statement here in the first paragraph when you say, \u201c Inflation has made progress, \u201d dropping the word \u201cfurther progress, \u201d and in the second paragraph dropping the sentence that  the Committee had \u201cgained greater confidence\u201d  that inflation was progressing towards its 2 percent goal.   Is there any policy substance behind either of those changes in l anguage?  Is it\u2014 is it meant to open the door to a December pause?  Is it meant to communicate anything about the stickiness of core inflation in the last three months?\n\nNovember  7, 2024   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nCHAIR POWELL.  Not really, no.  So let me tell you what we were thinking.  So the test of gaining further confidence was a \u2014was our test for the first rate cut, right?  And so we , we met that test in September, and therefore we take that test out.   If you leave it in, then it \u2019s new forward guidance.  It \u2019s brand new forward guidance.  \u201c What do you mean by it?  Are you\u2014are you making \u2014are you requiring yet further  guidance? \u201d  We have to say \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d at every meeting whether we \u2019ve made further progress. The point is we have gained confidence that , that  we\u2019re on a sustainable path down to 2 percent.  So that , I would tell you, is , is what that \u2019s really all about.  And it \u2019s not meant to send a signal.  Neither of those is meant to send a further signal.  And , you know, saying \u201c further progress \u201d it becomes a test where we don \u2019t want to be \u2014we don\u2019 t think it\u2019 s a good time to be doing a lot of , of forward guidance. You know, we \u2019re\u2014there \u2019s a fair amount of uncertainty in that \u2014in what I \u2019ve said .  The path that we \u2019re on, we do know what \u2014where the destination is, but we don\u2019 t know the right pace, and we don\u2019 t know exactly where the destination is .  So the \u2014the \u2014the  point is to find that, to find the right pace and the right destination as we go.  And I think there \u2019s a fair amount of uncertainty about that , and , you know, you don\u2019 t want to tie yourself up with , with  guidance . You want to be able to make sensible decisions as you go. MICHELLE SMITH.  Steve. STEVE LIESMAN.  Steve Li esman, CNBC.  Mr. Chairman, you talked about higher rates, perhaps from an expectation  of higher growth.  You didn\u2019 t talk about it in terms of expectations of higher deficits.  Is that something you think might be behind the recent rise in interest rates, and is that \u2014are rising deficits a concern to you?\n\nNovember  7, 2024   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nCHAIR POWELL.  So we don\u2019t comment on  fiscal policy , and, again, I don\u2019 t have a lot more to say on, on what \u2019s driving bond yields.  In terms of , of policy changes, though, let me give you a sense of how this , this  works in the ordinary case.  Let\u2019s say Congress is considering a rewrite of the tax laws ; it doesn\u2019 t matter what \u2019s in the content.  So we would follow that.  At a certain point , we\u2019d, we\u2019d  think we see the outline, so we \u2019d start to model it.  And then we \u2019d wait , and we \u2019d wait, and, at a certain point, the staff would brief the FOMC and say, you know, \u201c This is\u2014these are the likely effects. \u201d  There \u2019s lots and lots of literature on the effects of tax policy changes on various parts of the economy.  So we \u2019d, we\u2019d  try to get smart on that.  And then the law actually passes, and, you know, you\u2019 d start to put it\u2014you \u2019d probably run an alternative simulation before that happens, just to keep  people trying to understand it .  Then, then when it actually passes, it goes into the model, along with a million other things. So, you know, these \u2014we have a very large economy.  Many things are affecting it at any given time.  And, you know, a law change of some kind would go in there, but \u2014it would go in, but it would \u2014you know, it \u2019s a process that takes some time.  Clearly , the legislative process takes a lot of time.  And , of course, the real question is not the effect of that law .  It\u2019s all of the policy changes that are happening.  What\u2019s the net effect and, you know, the overall effect on the economy at a ny given time ?  So I th ink that \u2019s a\u2014that\u2019s a process that takes a lot of time and that we go through all the time with every A dministration , constantly.  And I just \u2014this will be no different.  But , you know, right now , we\u2019re\u2014there \u2019s nothing to\u2014there\u2019s nothing to model right now.  I t\u2019s such an early stage.  We don \u2019t know what the policies are, and once we know what they are, we won\u2019 t\u2014we won\u2019t  have a sense of, you know, when they\u2019 ll be implemented or, or  all those sorts of things.  So I think I would just say \u2014 STEVE LIESMAN.  Mm -hmm.\n\nNovember  7, 2024   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nCHAIR POWELL.  \u2014w e\u2019re not doing that now, and all that will take time, and it will be very much regular order when we do do that. STEVE LIESMAN.  If I could just follow up on Nick\u2019 s question\u2014a re the current rates something you feel like you need to lean against , in that they go against the direction of policy by being\u2014adding restriction to the economy?   Or do you just take them as a given or perhaps a signal that you should do less? CHAIR POWELL.  I \u2014look, I just think\u2014the first question is , how long will they be sustained?  If you remember the 5 percent 10- year, people were drawing massively important conclusions only to find, you know, three weeks later that the 10-year was 50 basis points lower. So, you know, it \u2019s material changes and financial conditions that last, that are persistent, that really matter.  And we don\u2019 t know that about these.  What we\u2019 ve seen so far ?  You know, we \u2019re watching it .  We\u2019re reading .  You know, we \u2019re doing the decompositions and reading others, but right now it \u2019s not a major factor in , in how we \u2019re thinking about things. MICHELLE SMITH.  Chris. CHRIS TOPHER RUGABER.  Thank you.  Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.  You mentioned the positive economic data that we \u2019ve seen since the September meeting, including the revisions to things like savings, higher GDP growth.  We saw  a stock market jump yesterday. That\u2019s renewed some of the questions about  why, why do many cuts at all in this \u2014with this backdrop? CHAIR POWELL.  So you\u2019 re right .  As I mentioned, and as you mentioned, the latest economic data have been strong, and that \u2019s, of course, a great thing and highly welcome.   But , of course, our mandate is maximum for employment and price stability, and we think that even with today\u2019 s cut, policy is still restrictive.  We understand it \u2019s not possible to say precisely how\n\nNovember  7, 2024   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nrestrictive, but we feel that it is still restrictive.  And if you look at our goal variables, the labor market has cooled a great deal from its overheated state of two years ago and is now essentially in balance.  It is continuing to cool, albeit at a \u2014at a modest rate, and we don\u2019 t need further cooling, we don\u2019 t think, to achieve our inflation mandate.  So that \u2019s the labor market. Inflation has moved down a great deal from its higher \u2014its highs of two years ago, and we judge d, as I mentioned, that it\u2019 s on a sustainable path back to 2 percent.  So the job\u2019 s not done on inflation.  But if you look at those two things, we judged in September that it was appropriate to begin to recalibrate our policy stance to reflect this progress, and today\u2019 s decision is really another step in that process.  Overall, as I mentioned, we believe that with an appropriate recalibration of our policy stance, we can maintain strength in the labor market even as our policy stance enables further progress toward our inflation goal. CHRIS TOPHER RUGABER.  Great.  And just to follow up, could you\u2014 what might cause you to pause rate cuts in December ?  What kind of economic data would lead you to that path?  Thank you. CHAIR POWELL.  So we haven\u2019 t, you know, made any decision like that at all.  But we\u2019re\u2014so we \u2019re in the process, as I mentioned, of moving policy down \u2014our stance down over time to a more neutral level.  And , as a general matter, as we move ahead , we are prepared to adjust our assessments of the appropriate pace and destination as the outlook evolves.  So, for example, if we were to see the labor market deteriorating, we \u2019d be prepared to move more quickly.  Alternatively, as we approach levels that are plausibly neutral or close to neutral, it may turn out to be appropriate to slow the pace at which we \u2019re dialing back restriction. Again, haven\u2019 t made any decisions about that, but that \u2019s certainly a possibility.  If you \u2014 you can think of it as similar to what we do with asset purchase\u2014with asset  runoff with QT.  So\n\nNovember  7, 2024   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nwe reach a point where we slow the pace, much like an airplane reaching the airport slows down. And so, you know, it \u2014we \u2019re thinking about it that way, but it \u2019s, it\u2019s something that we \u2019re just beginning to think about. MICHELLE SMITH.  Edward.  EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Thanks, Chair Powell.  So with , with  this noise in the jobs reports that we \u2019ve seen and you look at the Fed \u2019s favorite  inflation, PC E inflation, overall it\u2019 s 2.1 percent \u2014very close to the Fed \u2019s target \u2014but core inflation is 2. 7 percent , and it \u2019s been that way since July.  So why doesn\u2019 t this data give fuel to a rate pause for this meeting? CHAIR POWELL.  Well, so I think if you look at the 3 - and 6-month\u2014you \u2019re quoting the 12- month. EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Yes. CHAIR POWELL.  So we look at all of them, right ? EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Yes. CHAIR POWELL.  B ut if you look at three - and six -month core PCE, you\u2019 ll see they \u2019re around 2.3 percent .  So we look at all of them.  And we look at \u2014we also \u2014we look at 12 as well. But what it \u2019s telling us is that we really have made significant progress.  And we expect there to be bumps.  For example, you know , the, the last three months of last year,  the core PCE readings were very, very low \u2014probably unsustainably low.  So that \u2019s why you see \u2014that \u2019s why forecast s generally see a couple of upticks toward the end of the year.  On the other ha nd, the January reading certainly looks like an example of residual seasonality, so that we saw last year.   So when that falls out of the 12 -month calculation in February, we should see it staying down.  So there will literally be a bump up and then down.  We understand that.\n\nNovember  7, 2024   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nOverall, you see the progress on inflation, and you also look at the economy, and you say, \u201cWhat \u2019s\u2014what is the inflation story now?  Where is it coming from? \u201d  So I point to a couple of things.  One is the nonhousing services and goods, which together make up 80 percent  of that\u2014 of the core PCE index, are back to the levels they were at the last time we had sustained 2 percent inflation, which happens to be in the early 2000s for a period of five, six, seven years.  So they\u2019 re back at  that level.  What \u2019s not is housing services. So let \u2019s talk about housing services.  Housing services is higher.  What \u2019s going on there is, you know, market rents, newly signed leases, are experiencing very low inflation.  And what \u2019s happening is older , you know, leases that are turning over are taking several years to catch up to where market , market  leases are\u2014market rent leases are.  So that \u2019s just a catch -up problem.  It\u2019s not really reflecting current inflationary pressures ; it\u2019s reflecting past inflationary pressures.  So that\u2019s, that\u2019s  one thing. The other thing is , I\u2019d say look at the labor market \u2014not a source of inflationary pressures.  Where is it coming from?  It\u2019 s not a very tight economy.  What is the story about inflation?  You see that catch -up inflation also in insurance and in several other areas.  So you\u2019 re seeing \u2014we \u2019re not , not declaring victory, obviously, but we feel like the story is very consistent with inflation continuing to come down on a bumpy path over the next couple of years and settling around 2 percent.  That story is intact, and it won \u2019t be one or two really good data months , or bad data months aren \u2019t going to really change the pattern at this point , now that we \u2019re this fa r into the process. EDWARD LAWRENCE.  So you\u2019 re quickly trying to get to that neutral rate that you see, or do you foresee that you have some time to get there?\n\nNovember  7, 2024   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nCHAIR POWELL.  Nothing in the economic data suggests that the C ommittee has any need to be in a hurry to get there.  We are seeing strong economic activity .  We are seeing ongoing strength in the labor market; we \u2019re watching that carefully , but we do see maintaining strength there.  And so we think that the right way\u2014the right way to find neutral, if you will, is carefully, patiently.  Again, that \u2019s not meant to have a specific meaning other than we \u2014to the extent \u2014to the extent  the economy remains strong, we  have the ability to, to  take advantage of that as we try to navigate that middle path between the two risks . MICHELLE SMITH.  Craig. CRAIG TORRES.   Hi, Chair Powell .  Craig Torres from Bloomberg.  Two questions today.  D id you learn anything about what Americans think about the economy from the election results?   First question.  Second question\u2014I want to talk about some labor market indicators, and I do so with great respect for your attentiveness to the maximum -employment side of the mandate, Chair Powell. So the unemployment rate has been at 4 percent or higher for six months.  One of the broadest measures of unemployment is up about a half a point from a year ago.  Compensation gains are sliding back.  The quits rate, a signal of labor market dynamism, has been heading down to that bad neighborhood of the 20- teens .  So you have put a marker at Jackson Hole saying any \u201c further cooling \u201d is unwelcome.   It is cooling, generally, a little bit further.  So at what point do we reach what you would describe as a shortfall from maximum employment? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL.  Sure.  So on your first question, I \u2019m not going to talk about anything that relates directly or indirectly to the election.  On the second one, you\u2019 re\u2014you know, this is the great question, and it \u2019s the one we think about all the time.  So I \u2019ll just say a couple things.\n\nNovember  7, 2024   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nYou know, there \u2019s nothing really surprising here.  What we know is that the unemployment rate is low.  We also know that it \u2019s come down significantly\u2014sorry, moved up significantly from a year or so ago.  So we \u2019ve seen a big change upward in unemployment. Sometimes that has meant bad things.  So far, it doesn\u2019 t appear to be .  It appears that the \u2014I wouldn\u2019 t say that the labor market has fully stabilized, because I do think it\u2019 s continuing to very gradually cool, but it seem s to be in a good place.  And our policy, of course, is designed to keep it in that good place, to maintain the strength in the labor market, while also enabling further progress on inf lation. You know, you mentioned a bunch of , of indicators, and you \u2019re right .  You know, the , the openings to unemployment rate is back to a normal level.  I would\u2014I would characterize it more broadly as \u201cnormalizing .\u201d  You mentioned wages.  Wages are still running just a bit above where they would need to be to be consistent with 2 percent inflation, unless productivity is going to remain at this high level.  If we see the\u2014if we see productivity, you know, more sustainabl y at these high levels, then that would sustain higher wage gains .  So I would say\u2014in fact, you can say it the other way, that , that  wage increases are now consistent with 2 percent inflation given current productivity readings. But, of course, you know, the lore on productivity readings is whenever you see high readings, you should assume they \u2019re going to revert pretty quickly to the longer -term trend.  That has always been the case for 50 years.  But , you know, it may be that \u2014we \u2019re now five years .  If you look at the NIPA revisions that came out a month ago, we \u2019re five years into , into a nice set of productivity readings , which are sustained and very healthy.  But , overall, it \u2019s a good labor market.  We could talk about 20 differ ent data series.  We \u2019ll be looking at all of them, of course.\n\nNovember  7, 2024   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nBut, you know, we don\u2019 t want the labor market to , to soften much from here.  We don \u2019t think we need that to happen to get inflation back to 2 percent. MICHELLE SMITH.  Victoria. VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi.  Victoria Guida with Politico.  Some of the P resident -elect\u2019s advis ers have suggested that you should resign.  If he asked you to leave, would you go? CHAIR POWELL.  No. VICTORIA GUIDA.  Can you follow up on is \u2014do you think that legally that you\u2019 re not required to leave? CHAIR POWELL.  No.  MICHELLE SMITH.  Mike . MICHAEL MCKEE.  Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television.  You talk a lot about what the data are telling you and how you are dependent on the data.  But in terms of forward -looking assessments of the economy, what are you hearing from CEOs or other officials around the country?  What did you hear today from the regional B ank presidents about what companies and consumers think about where the economy is going from here, rather than looking backwards?  And does that match up with what your forecasts have been and what you think the appropriate policy path should be? CHAIR POWELL.  So it \u2019s hard to characterize a, you know, really interesting set of discussions we had , and, of course , you \u2019ll see them in the minute s in three weeks.  But I would say this .  I think, you know, the comments from our R eserve Bank colleagues and from the CEOs that they talk to are pretty constructive on the economy right now \u2014pretty constructive, feeling that the labor market is,  is, you know, back to normal to the point where it \u2019s no longer\n\nNovember  7, 2024   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nthat much of a discussion topic in their world, whereas two years ago, it was all they were talking about.  So they feel like the labor market\u2019 s in balance. People feel good about where the economy is.  Demand is obviously pretty strong.  And, you know, you\u2019 re seeing, what, 2.8 percent  growth in the third quarter estimated .  Maybe the year is 2\u00bd.  This is \u2014this is \u2014you know, this is a strong economy.  It \u2019s actually remarkable how well the U .S. economy has been performing with, you know, strong growth, a strong labor market, inflation coming down.  We\u2019 re, you know, really performing better than any of our global peers.  And I think that is reflected in what you hear from \u2014what I hear people hear from CEOs.  I don\u2019 t get to talk to a lot of CEOs in my job, but I hear what others summarize from those.  And , of course, I hear the Reserve B ank presidents do a lot of that, and it \u2019s pretty constructive overall.  Now, that \u2019s not to say \u2014there are areas of caution and things like that but , ultimately, overall pretty positive. MICHAEL MCKEE.  To follow up on the areas of caution, if  there were black clouds on the horizon that you identified as something you \u2019re watching, what would they be? CHAIR POWELL.  I think it \u2019s\u2014you know, it \u2019s things like \u2014clearly , geopolitical risks around the world are elevated, and just as clearly, they\u2019 ve had relatively little effect on the U .S. economy.  Now, that can change through the price of oil or otherwise, but people talk about those as, you know, something that \u2019s on the horizon all the time.  But , you know, ultimately, if you look at the U .S. economy, its , its performance has been very good.  And that \u2019s, that\u2019s  what we hear from businesspeople, an expectation that that will continue.  If anything, people feel next year\u2014I\u2019ve heard this from several people\u2014that next year could even be stronger than this year. MICHELLE SMITH.  Andrew.\n\nNovember  7, 2024   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nANDREW ACKERMAN.  Hi.  It\u2019s Andrew Ackerman with t he Washington Pos t.  I just wanted to follow up on the discussion earlier on fiscal policy .  Your predecessors Greenspan and Volcker spoke up loudly when they thought large budget deficits endangered financial \u2014 economic or financial stability.  Will you do that, too?  And , right now , we\u2019re in a period of full employment .  We have large budget deficits and debt at historic , historic  highs that are \u2014and rising.  Is that something you\u2019 d speak out against? CHAIR POWELL.  So , you know, I have said many times no more, no less than what the predecessors you mentioned have said.  And what that is is that the U.S. fiscal \u2014federal government \u2019s fiscal path \u2014fiscal policy  is on an unsustainable path.  The level of our debt relative to the economy is not unsustainable.  The path is unsustainable.  And we see that.  And, you know, you\u2019 ve got  a very large deficit at\u2014you \u2019re at full employment, and that \u2019s expected to continue.  So it \u2019s important that we \u2014you know, that that be dealt with .  It is ultimately a threat to the economy.  Now, I can say that .  I don\u2019 t have oversight .  We don\u2019 t have oversight over fiscal policy.  I \u2019ve said it on many occasions \u2014just said it again. ANDREW ACKERMAN.  Okay .  Thank you.  I guess the only other question is \u2014to follow up on Victoria \u2019s question \u2014do you believe the P resident has the power to fire or demote you, and has the Fed determined the legality of a President demoting at will any of the other Governors with leadership positions? CHAIR POWELL.  Not permitted under the law. ANDREW ACKERMAN.  Not what? CHAIR POWELL.  Not permitted under the law.  ANDREW ACKERMAN.  Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH.  Courtenay.\n\nNovember  7, 2024   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nCOURTENAY BROWN.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Courtenay Brown from Axios.  In response to Howard \u2019s question, you said it wasn\u2019 t an ideal time to give forward  guidance because of the economic uncertainties.  Can you lay out what some of those uncertainties are and whether or not it includes some of the proposals that the President -elect has put out on the campaign trail \u2014 tariffs, for instance? CHAIR POWELL.  No .  I was not referring to , to the new A dministration \u2019s policies at all, nor will I today.  So I \u2014what I \u2019m just saying is , as we look ahead, we know \u2014and I mentioned this in my statement\u2014that the risks are two  sided.  I guess I should start by saying that we think that the economy and we think our policy are both in a very good place , a very good place.  And\u2014but as you look forward, you say, \u201c What are the risks? \u201d  And one risk is that we would move too quickly and find ourselves having moved too quickly, and inflation comes back , and we \u2014and we  lost our chance to get inflation back to 2 percent.  So we have to avoid that risk.  And that , that \u2014to avoid that risk, that means you want to move carefully.  The other risk is that we move too slowly and that we allow the labor market to weaken too much and do unnecessary damage to the labor market and to people \u2019s working lives.  That, that  says , \u201cDon\u2019t get behind the curve.\u201d So these are two \u2014these two things are the two risks that we have to manage.  And so we\u2019re, we\u2019re  in the middle there.  We try to be in the middle and deal with both of the \u2014manage both of those.  Again, the idea is to maintain support, the strength that we have in the labor market and  in the economy, but also with somewhat less restrictive but still restrictive policy, enable further progress toward our 2 percent inflation goal.  A nd so there \u2019s\u2014you know, there \u2014 this is the thing :  Meeting by meeting , we\u2019re going to be making our assessment of what the right path is.\n\nNovember  7, 2024   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nYou know, it \u2019s not as important \u2014the precise timing of these things is not as important as the overall arc of them, and the arc of them is to move from where we are now to a  sense of neutral, a  more neutral policy.  We don \u2019t know exactly where that is ; we only know it by its works.  We\u2019 re pretty sure it \u2019s below where we are now.  But as we move further, there will be more uncertainty about where that is .  And we \u2019re going to move carefully as , as this goes on so that, you know, we can increase the chances that we will get it right. MICHELLE SMITH.  Simon. SIMON RABINOVITCH.  Thank you, Chair Powell .  Simon Rabinovitch with t he Economist .  I know you don\u2019 t want to share your decomposition of bond yields, but if you look at the breakevens, it , it is clear that longer- term inflation expectations do seem to have risen up at about 2.5 percent , for example, on the five -year.  That\u2019s up half a point from when you cut in September.  Do you have any concern at all that longer -term inflation expectations are deanchoring or , put another way, are anchoring at a slightly higher level?  Thanks. CHAIR POWELL .  So we , we would be concerned if we saw \u2014if we thought we saw longer -term inflation expectations anchoring at a higher level.  That \u2019s not what we \u2019re seeing. We\u2019re still seeing between surveys and market readings broadly consistent  with \u2014you know, I , I looked at the five -year, five-year earlier today , and it \u2019s probably moved, but it \u2019s just not \u2014it\u2019s just\u2014it\u2019s kind of right where it \u2019s been, and also it \u2019s pretty close to  consistent with 2 percent PCE inflation.  So that \u2019s one that \u2019s been a traditio nal one that we look at a lot.  But, overall, expectations seem to be \u2014and really have throughout  this\u2014in a place that \u2019s consistent with 2 percent inflation.  But you\u2019 re right to say we watch that very carefully, and we will not allow inflation expectations to drift upward.  But that \u2019s, that\u2019s  really why we reacted so sharply back in 2022 was , was  to avoid that.\n\nNovember  7, 2024   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nMICHELLE SMITH.  Kelly. KELLY O\u2019GRADY.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Kelly O \u2019Grady, CBS News.  We just talked about what you\u2019 ve heard from business leaders on the economy , but many average Americans are still not feeling the strength of the economy in their wallets.  So what \u2019s your message to them on when they might expect relief? CHAIR POWELL.   So you\u2019 re right that, you know, we say that the economy is performing well, and it is, but we also know that people are still feeling the effects of high prices, for example.  And we went through \u2014the world went through a global inflation shock, and inflation went up everywhere.  And , you know, it , it stays with you because the price level doesn\u2019 t come back down.  So what that takes is it takes some years of real wage gains for people to feel better.  And that \u2019s what we \u2019re\u2014that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to create.  And I think we \u2019re well on the road to creating that. Inflation has come way down.  T he economy is still strong here .  Wages are moving up but, but at a sustainable level.  So it \u2019s just \u2014I think \u2014I think what needs to happen is happening and, for the most part, has happened.  But it\u2019 ll be some time before people, you know, regain their confidence and feel that.  And , you know, we don\u2019 t tell people how to\u2014how to feel about the economy.  W e respect \u2014completely respect \u2014what they \u2019re feeling.  Those feelings are true ; they\u2019 re accurate.  We don \u2019t question them .  We\u2014you know, we respect them. KELLY O\u2019GRADY.  And just a quick follow -up\u2014President -elect Trump has been critical of your performance.  Any concern about his influence on the Fed \u2019s independence? CHAIR POWELL.

What is your plan if we start to see stagflation? CHAIR POWELL.  So that \u2019s a\u2014you know, the whole plan is not to have stagflation, so we don\u2019 t have to deal with it.  So that \u2019s our \u2014that is actually our plan.  [Laughter]  You know, it\u2019s, of course, a very difficult thing because you \u2019re\u2014you know, you\u2019 re\u2014anything you do with interest rates will, will  hurt one side or the other, either the inflation mandate or the \u2014or the employment mandate. I would just say that, you know, we \u2019ve, we\u2019ve  been able to see inflation come down a whole lot, you know, much closer to our goal without the kind of sharp increase in unemployment that has often accompanied programs of disinflation.  So knock on wood, we \u2019ve gotten this far without seeing a real weakening in, in the labor market.  And we believe we can complete the inflation task while also keeping the labor market strong, and that, of course, is exactly what we\u2019 re trying to do. NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  Can you rule out an interest rate hike next year? CHAIR POWELL.  I \u2014no.  I wouldn\u2019 t rule anything out  or in that far away.  But that \u2019s certainly not , not our plan.  I mean, our baseline expectation is that we \u2019ll continue to move gradually down towards neutral, that the economy will continue to grow at a healthy clip, and that the labor market will remain strong.  If you look at our \u2014look at our \u2014that will not change from the September S EP.  You know, t hat is our baseline forecast .

I wanted to go back to a comment that you had made about Americans being quite unhappy about the cumulative price level rises over the past few years, even though now inflation is back on a path to 2 percent.  Would it be appropriate for the Fed to undershoot for a while on its inflation goal under the average inflation- targeting regime so people have a chance to catch up? CHAIR POWELL.  No .  That\u2019s, that\u2019s  not the way our framework works.  We\u2019 re aiming for inflation at, at  2 percent.  We\u2019 re\u2014we do not have \u2014we do not think it would be appropriate to deliberately undershoot.  And , you know, part of the problem there is that low inflation can be a problem, too, in a way.  But that \u2019s not part of our framework, and it \u2019s not something we \u2019re going to be \u2014going to be  looking at in our framework review. Thank you very much."

My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on achieving our dual -mandate goals  of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of the American people.  The economy is strong overall and has made significant progress toward our, our goals over the past two years.  The labor market has cooled from its formerly overheated state and remains solid.  Inflation has moved much closer to our 2  percent longer -run goal. We\u2019re committed to maintaining our economy \u2019s strength by supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to our 2 percent goal.  To that end, today, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to take another step in reducing the degree of policy restraint by lowering our policy interest rate by \u00bc percentage point.  We also decided to continue to reduce our securities holdings.  I \u2019ll have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments. Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a \u2014at a  solid pace.  GDP rose at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in the third quarter, about the same pace as in the second quarter.  Growth of consumer spending has remained resilient, and investment in equipment and intangibles has strengthened.  In contrast, act ivity in the housing sector has been weak.  Overall, improving supply conditions have supported the strong performance of the U.S. economy over the past year.  In our Summary  of Economic Projections , Committee participants generally expect GDP growth to remain solid, with a median projection of about 2 percent over the next few years. In the labor market, conditions remain solid.  Payroll job gains have slowed from earlier in the year, averaging 173,000 per month over the past three months.  The unemployment rate is higher than it was a year ago, but , at 4.2 percent in November, it has remained low.  Nominal\n\nDecember 18 , 2024   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nwage growth has eased over the past year, and the jobs- to-workers gap has narrowed.  Overall, a broad set of indicators suggests that conditions in the labor market are now less tight than in 2019.  The labor market is not a source of significant inflationary pressures.  The median projection for the unemployment rate in the SEP is 4.2 percent at the end of this year and 4.3 percent over the next few years. Inflation has eased significantly over the past two years but remains somewhat elevated relative to our 2 percent longer -run goal.  Estimates based on the c onsumer price i ndex and other data indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.5 percent over the 12  months ending in November , and that, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent.  Longer -term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets.  The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 2.4 percent this year and 2.5 percent next year, somewhat higher than projected in September.  Thereafter, the median projection falls to our 2  percent object ive. Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.  We see the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals as being roughly in balance, and we are attentive to the r isks on both sides of our mandate. At today\u2019 s meeting, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by \u00bc percentage point, to 4\u00bc- 4\u00bd percent.  We\u2019ve  been moving policy toward a more neutral setting in order to maintain the strength of the economy and the labor market while establishing further progress  in\u2014sorry, enabling further progress  on\u2014inflation.  With today\u2019 s action, we have lowered our policy rate by a full percentage point from its peak, and our policy stance is\n\nDecember 18 , 2024   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nnow significantly less restrictive.  We can therefore be more cautious as we consider further adjustments to our policy rate. We know that reducing policy restraint too fast or too much could hinder progress on inflation.  At the same time, reducing policy restraint too slowly or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment.  In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.  We \u2019re not on any preset course. In our S ummary of E conomic P rojections , FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an appropriate path for the federal funds rate, based on what each participant judges to be the most likely scenario going forward.  The median participant projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 3.9 percent at the end of next year and 3.4 percent at the end of 2026.  These median projections are somewhat higher than in September, consistent with the firmer inflation projection.   These projections, however, are not a Committee plan or decision. As the economy evolves, monetary policy will adjust in order to best promote our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.  If the economy remains strong and inflation does not continue to move sustainably toward 2 percent, we can dial back policy restraint more slowly.  If the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated, we can ease policy more quickly.  Policy is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate. On a technical note :  We lowered the offering rate on our overnight reverse repo facility to align it with the bottom of the target range for the federal funds rate \u2014its typical configuration. Technical adjustments of this kind have no bearing on the stance of monetary policy.\n\nDecember 18 , 2024   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nThe Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy :  maximum employment and stable prices.  We remain committed to supporting maximum employment, bringing inflation sustainably to our 2 percent goal, and keeping longer -term inflation expectations well anchored. Our success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans.  We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country.  Everything we do is in service to our public mission.  We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.  Thank you, and I look forward to your questions. MICHELLE SMITH.  Jeanna.  JEANNA SMIALEK.  Jeanna Smialek with the New York Times.  Thank you for taking our questions.  I, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about why officials think it\u2019 s appropriate to cut rates at all in 2025 if inflation is expected to remain firm throughout the year.  And what would you expect, at this point, the timing might look like?  Would a January cut potentially be possible , or does a pause next month seem more likely? CHAIR POWELL.  Well, so let , let me start by saying why we \u2014why we cut today and then\u2014and then move to 2025.  So I would say today was a \u2014was a closer call, but we decided it was the right call because we thought it was the best decision to foster achievement of both of our goals, maximum employment and price stability .  We see the risks as two -sided :  moving too slowly and needlessly undermine economic activity and the labor market, or move too quickly and needlessly undermine our progress on inflation.  So we \u2019re trying to steer between those two risks , and, on balance , we decided to go ahead with a further cut .  And  I, I\u2019ll give you some details on why.\n\nDecember 18 , 2024   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nDownside risks to the labor market do appear to have diminished, but the labor market is now looser than pre -pandemic , and it \u2019s clearly still cooling further, s o far in, in a gradual and orderly way.  We don\u2019 t think we need further cooling in the labor market to get inflation down to 2 percent .  Job creation is now well  below the level or certainly below the level that would hold unemployment constant , the job -finding rate is low and declining, and other measures \u2014such as surveys of  workers and businesses, quits, things like that \u2014broadly show a , a much cooler labor market than th ere was, than we had in 2019.  It\u2019 s still quite gradually cooling.  So we , we keep an eye on that . Inflation, we see that story as still broadly on track , and, and I \u2019ll tell you why.  We, w e\u2019ve made a great deal of progress.  Twelve -month core inflation, as I mentioned, through November is estimated at 2.8  percent , down from a high of 5.6 percent .  Twelve \u2014but 12- month  inflation has actually been moving sideways, as we are \u201c lapping\u201d  very low readings of late last year . Housing services inflation actually is steadily coming down now, albeit at a slower pace than we might like , but it has now come down substantially and it is making progress, slower than hoped. And we, we \u2019ve had recent high readings from nonmarket services and some bumpiness for goods .  So I \u2019ll just say, we, we \u2014so remember that we couple this decision today with the \u201c extent and timing\u201d  language in the postmeeting statement that signals that we are at or near a point at which it will be appropriate to slow the pace  of further adjustments . You ask about 2025.  I , I think that the lower\u2014the slower pace of cuts for next year really reflects both the higher inflation readings we \u2019ve had this year and the expectation that inflation will be higher .  You saw in the SEP that risks and, and  uncertainty around inflation we see as higher .  Nonetheless, we, we  see ourselves as, as  still on track to continue to cut .  I think the actual cuts that we make next year will not be because of anything we wrote down today.\n\nDecember 18 , 2024   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nWe\u2019re, w e\u2019re going to react to data .  That\u2019s just the  general sense of what the Committee thinks is likely to be appropriate. JEANNA SMIALEK.  Sorry, just one , one  quick follow -up:  Why, I guess, would you make those cuts?   Like,  what would\u2014what would be the trigger to cut? CHAIR POWELL.  So we \u2019re\u2014to, to cut further after this point, I, I  would say it this way:  We\u2019ve reduced our policy rate now by 100 basis points .  We\u2019 re significantly closer to neutral .  At 4 .3 percent and \u201c change,\u201d  we believe policy is still meaningfully restrictive .  But as for additional cuts, we \u2019re going to be looking for further progress on inflation as well as continued strength in the labor market .  And as long as the economy and the labor market are solid, we can be cautious about \u2014as we consider furt her cuts .  And all of that is reflected \u2014to your question\u2014in the December SEP, which shows a median forecast of down [to] two cuts next year, compared to four in September. MICHELLE SMITH.  Howard. HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Howard Schneider with Reuters , and thanks for the opportunity to ask you a question.  So this does seem similar to the dynamic in 2016 during the last transition to a Trump A dministration, where the Committee saw slightly tighter policy in part in expected anticipation of the fiscal policy stance that was seen evolving over the year . Some of it was a data mark -to-market exercise, and some of it was anticipation of fiscal .  What \u2019s the split on this one?  How much of this was accounting for inflation data that was coming in, and how much of it is expecting that there will be inflationary fiscal policy next year? CHAIR POWELL.  I, I \u2019d say \u2014I\u2019d, I\u2019d  point to five or six things, and, and  I\u2019d start \u2014let me start by saying that we think the economy\u2019s in a really good place , and we think policy\u2019s  in a really good place .  Let \u2019s remember that the economy \u2019s growing 2\u00bd percent this year, that\n\nDecember 18 , 2024   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\ninflation has come down by 50 percent  to, to\u2014 from 5.6 percent  to 2.6 percent .  Headline inflation is 2.5  percent  on a 12- month basis .  We\u2019re actually in a really good starting place here . But since , you know \u2014so , so what \u2019s really driving the , the slower rate- cut path?  First thing is growth is stronger, right?  We, the economy grew faster in the second half of 2024, so far, than we had expected and is expected to be above what our expectations in September next year as well .  Unemployment is lower, and, you know, in the SEP, you\u2019 ll see that participants think that the \u2014that the  downside risks are less and uncertainty is less.  And s o that \u2019s, that\u2019s  more strength, right? Inflation is higher, as we talked about .  Inflation \u2019s higher this year .  It\u2019s also higher in the forecast next year .  I\u2019d also point out that we \u2019re, we\u2019re  closer to the neutral rate, which is another reason to be cautious about , about  further moves .  And\u2014but then getting to your \u2014to your point, there \u2019s also, there \u2019s uncertainty \u2014uncertainty around inflation,  I pointed out , is actually higher . It\u2019s also \u2014it\u2019s also , in the case of some people, some people \u2014the way I \u2019d say it is this :  Some people did take a very preliminary step and start to incorporate highly conditional estimates of economic effects of policies into their forecast at this meeting and said so in the meeting .  Some people said they didn\u2019 t do so, and some people didn\u2019t, didn \u2019t say whether they did or not .  So we have people making a bunch of different approaches to that .  But some did identify policy uncertainty as one of the reasons for their , their  writing down more uncertainty around inflation. And, you know, the point of that uncertainty is , it\u2019s kind of commonsense thinking that when the path is uncertain you go a little bit slower .  It\u2019s not unlike driving on a foggy night or walking into a dark room full of furniture .  You just slow down.  And so that may have affected some of the people .  But as, as I said, there \u2019s a range of \u2014range of approaches on the Committee.\n\nDecember 18 , 2024   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER.  If I could follow  up on that :  You mentioned the risk and uncertainty indexes toward the back of the document .  The upside risk to inflation jumped quite substantially .  The only thing, really , that\u2019s happened\u2014you, you mentioned that the disinflationary story remains intact, yet the risk weighting has jumped to the upside .  The only real thing that\u2019 s happened is November  5th, in the meantime .  Is it fair to say that that \u2019s what \u2019s driving the higher sense of upside risk on inflation? CHAIR POWELL.  Actually, that \u2019s not the only thing that \u2019s happened.  What \u2019s happened is that our forecast for inflation for this year, I think , are five -tenths  higher than they were in September .  So, you\u2019 ve got \u2014you had two months of higher inflation, September and October . As I mentioned , November is, is back on track.  But, you know, once again we \u2019ve, you know, we\u2019ve had a year -end projection for inflation and it \u2019s kind of fallen apart as we\u2019 ve approached the end of the year .  So that is certainly a larg e factor in people \u2019s thinking.   I can tell you that might be the single biggest factor is inflation has once again underperformed relative to expectations .  It\u2019s still , you know, going to be between 2\u00bd and 3 [percent] .  It\u2019s way below where it was .  But, you know, we really want to see progress on inflation,  to, to, you know , as I mentioned, a s we think about further cuts, we \u2019re going to be looking for progress on inflation. We have been moving sideways on 12- month inflation as the 12 -month window moves .  That \u2019s in part because inflation was very, very low measured in, in the 4 th quarter of 2023. Nonetheless, as we go forward, we \u2019re going to want to be seeing further progress on bringing inflation down and keeping a solid labor market. MICHELLE SMITH.  Chris. CHRIS RUGABER.  Thank you.  Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.  Thanks for taking the question.  In September 2018, the Fed staff in the Tealbook  discussed a policy of \u201clooking\n\nDecember 18 , 2024   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nthrough\u201d  any new tariffs as long as they were one- time increases and inflation expectations remained anchored .  Could you comment on if that analysis remains effective and any other thinking on tariffs generally that you can share ? CHAIR POWELL.  So I do think that the 2018, the September 2018 Tealbook alternative simulations are a good place to start .  I happened to have brought them here with me today.  I \u2019m sure you have them too.  They\u2019re, t hey\u2019re a good starting point , and, and I would just say, you know, it\u2019 s six-years -old analysis .  But nonetheless , this is still, I think , I think the right, the right questions to ask.  A nd, you know, there, there were two simulations:   one was\u2014one was \u201c seeing through,\u201d  one was not .  And I point you to, you\u2019ll \u2014 there\u2019s some language in the \u2014in the \u201c see- through\u201d  paragraph.  I t says, you know, it considers situations in which it might be appropriate to \u201csee through \u201d inflation  and then, and then names some conditions that in , in which it might not be. In any case, this is not a question that \u2019s in front of us right now .  We, we  won \u2019t face that question\u2014w e don\u2019 t know when we \u2019ll face that question .  What the Committee \u2019s doing now is , is discussing pathways and understanding, again , the ways in which tariff- driven inflation can affect \u2014tariffs can affect inflation and the economy, and, and  how to think about that .  So, we\u2019re, we\u2019re \u2014we \u2019ve done a bit of , good bit of work, all of us have, each of us has, and, you know, it puts us in position, when we finally do see what the, what the  actual policies are, to be , to make , you know, a more, more careful, thoughtful assessment of what might be the appropriate policy response. CHRIS RUGABER.  Great, and just a quick follow [-up].  Do you, given the recent bout of inflation that we \u2019ve been through, with consumers seeing how , you know, prices can rise and businesses being \u2014seeing that they can raise prices, at least for some time, does that make it a\n\nDecember 18 , 2024   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nlittle bit riskier to look through tariffs?  I mean , are\u2014do you feel that you have to respond more quickly to inflation threats , given what we \u2019ve seen the past few years? CHAIR POWELL.  So the, the main thing is \u2014and this is also a point in these alternative simulations \u2014is that there \u2019re just many, many factors that go into what , what \u2014how much tariffs will, will  even go into consumer inflation.  How persistent will that be?  And, you know, s o, we just\u2014we just  don\u2019 t know , really , very much at all about the actual policies, so it \u2019s very premature to try to make any kind of conclusion.  We don\u2019 t know what \u2019ll be tariffed , from what countries, for how long, and what size .  We don\u2019 t know whether there \u2019ll be, you know, retaliatory tariffs .  We don \u2019t know what the, you know, the transmission of any of that will be into consumer prices . To your \u2014to your  point as well, I don \u2019t\u2014I wouldn\u2019 t say that we know whether the last episode is or is not a good model for what happened.  You pointed out we \u2019ve just been through a period of high inflation.   We\u2019ve just gotten through that period.  That \u2019s a difference .  It was also quite a bit of diversion of trade away from China to other countries , since that, that may \u2014that may have affects.  I don\u2019 t know .  I just think we , we need to take our time, not rush, and make a very careful assessment, but only when we \u2019ve actually seen what the policies are and how they\u2019 re implemented .  And, you know, we \u2019re just\u2014we \u2019re just not at that stage .  We \u2019re at the stage of doing what other forecasters are doing \u2014which is kind of thinking about these questions , but not , not trying to get to definitive answers for some time. MICHELLE SMITH.  Nick. NICK TIMIRAOS.  Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal .  Chair Powell, to make sure I understand, participants today revised up their core PCE inflation projection for \u201925 so that the central tendency runs from 2\u00bd to 2.7 percent,  and, as Howard noted earlier, most of the\n\nDecember 18 , 2024   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nCommittee sees the risks to those projections to the upside.  So if inflation only declines next year from 2.8 to 2.5 to 2.7, what would compel the Committee to be cutting in that situation? CHAIR POWELL.  Let me \u2014let me  find these numbers .  So we have \u2014we have  inflation coming down, core inflation coming down to 2\u00bd [percent] next year .  That\u2019s, that\u2019d  be\u2014that\u2019d be significant progress .  You see a slower path .  I think that does take on board that we want to see real progress.  But we, we, you know, we \u2019d be seeing meaningful progress to get inflation down to that level .  That wouldn\u2019 t be all the way to 2 percent,  but that would be , it would be , you know, better than this year .  This year , [it] wi ll be 2.8 or 2.9.  That would be meaningful .  We, we also have to think about the , the, you know, the  labor market .  And while we , we have the labor market forecast as being in good shape, we are also mindful that it is still out there very gradually cooling, so far in an orderly , gradual way.  But it\u2019 s also something we need to keep our eye on. NICK TIMIRAOS.  I , I guess , if I could follow  up:  If somebody looked at these projections and also the insertion of the \u201cextent and timing \u201d language in the statement, which has been used at times in the past when the Committee thinks maybe it \u2019s going to be on hold for a while , and they said, \u201c Gee, this looks like it could be the last rate cut for some time ,\u201d would they be mistaken to , to infer that? CHAIR POWELL.  So that \u2019s, that\u2019s not the \u2014that\u2019s not any decision that we \u2019ve made at all.  Let me explain \u201c extent and timing.\u201d   So the , the sense of that wording is to make clear that if the economy does evolve about as anticipated, we \u2019re at a point at which it would be appropriate to slow the pace of rate cuts.  So \u201c extent, \u201d that just relates to how , how  much further we can reduce our policy rate consistent with getting to a neutral stance .  Clearly , that distance has shrunk by 100 basis points .  So it \u2019s significantly smaller.  So that \u2019s, that\u2019s  the \u201c extent \u201d question.\n\nDecember 18 , 2024   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nAnd, again, we \u2019re going to be looking for further progress on inflation, as well as a strong labor market, to make those cuts. \u201cTiming \u201d just suggests , again , that we \u2019re at a place where we,  we, assuming the economy develops as expected, we\u2019 re at or near a level that will make it appropriate to slow the pace of adjustments .  So that, that \u2019s what we mean by that .  We\u2019 re not trying to make decisions about the longer  run. You know, we are, we \u2019re trying to make sensible policy as we go .  And , you know, I just would emphasize the uncertainty , which is, it \u2019s just \u2014it\u2019s just  a function of the fact that, that we expect significant policy cha nges.  There\u2019s nothing really unusual about that .  I think we need to, we need to see what they are and see what the effects they will have.  We\u2019ll, w e\u2019ll have a much clearer picture , I think, you know, when that happens. MICHELLE SMITH.  Mike. MICHAEL MCKEE.  Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television.  Even though you\u2019 ve cut rates by 100 basis points this year, we haven \u2019t seen much change in mortgages, auto loan rates, or credit card rates .  You say you\u2019 re significantly restrictive .  Are you running a risk that the markets are fighting against you and the economy could be more at risk of a slowdown than you anticipate? CHAIR POWELL.  So the , the risks that you\u2014sorry, the rates that you talked about are , are really longer -run rates , and they \u2019re affected, they are affected to some extent by Fed policy, but they \u2019re also affected by many other things .  And longer rates have actually gone up quite a bit since September, as, as  you well know, and those are the things that drive, for example, mortgage rates more than short- term rates do .  So we look at that, but we look at all financial conditions , and then we look at what \u2019s hap pening in the economy.  S o what we see happening in the economy, again, is , you know, most forecasters have been calling for a slowdown in growth\n\nDecember 18 , 2024   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nfor a very long time, and it keeps not happening.  So we have \u2014we \u2019re now well into another year of growth.  I t looks like it might be 2 \u00bd percent .  Third and\u2014 second and third quarters were right about at the same level .  So the U.S. economy is just performing very, very well .  Substantially better than our global peer group.  And I, I \u2014there \u2019s no reason to think a downturn is , is any more likely than it\u2014 than it usually is . So, the outlook is pretty bright for our economy.  We have to stay on task , though, and continue to have restrictive policies so that we can get inflation down to 2 percent .  We\u2019re also going to be looking out for the labor market .  We want to keep the labor market pretty close to where it is .  We\u2019re pretty close to estimates of the , the natural rate of unemployment.  J ob creation is , is a little below the , the level that would keep it there but , nonetheless, close.  And so that\u2019s what our policy\u2019 s trying t o achieve. MICHAEL MCKEE.  If I could follow  up by asking about \u2014your formulation for beginning rate cuts included the phrase \u201c we need to have confidence that inflation is moving down towards our target .\u201d  Given the fact that you \u2019ve raised your forecast for next year, do you have confidence or are you uncertain about the path of inflation going forward? CHAIR POWELL.  So confidence was our test for raising rates , and, you know, we \u2019ve made \u2014look , look at the broader suite:   We\u2019ve made just a great deal of progress.  We\u2019re, you know, we\u2019re  well into the 2\u2019 s in, in core inflation and around 2\u00bd [percent] \u2014or even lower than that, we have been \u2014for headline inflation .  So I , I would say I \u2019m confident that inflation has come down a great deal , and I, I \u2019m confident in the story about why it \u2019s come down and why that portends well.  And I \u2019ll\u2014and I\u2019ll  tell you why.  You, a gain, you do see with housing services inflation, which is one that we \u2019ve really worried, worried about, it really has come down now quite steadily, at a slower pace than we thought , you know, two years ago, but it \u2019s\n\nDecember 18 , 2024   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nnonetheless steadily coming down as , as market rents , you know, market rents  start to equilibrate better with , you know, new leases that turn  over .  Not, not new tenants , but new leases.  Market rents is new leases.  So that, that \u2019s happening;  that process is ongoing pretty much as we expect . Goods inflation, which is another big piece of it, has returned right to the range where it was before the pandemic .  Just for some months this year it kind of moved up in a bumpy way because of used cars and things like that .  But we think, overall , that should generally be in the range it was in .  Then  that leaves nonhousing services, and market -based nonhousing services are in, in good shape .  It\u2019s nonmarket services, and those are \u2014those are services that are imputed rather than measured directly , and they, they don \u2019t, we , we think they don\u2019 t really tell us much about the , you know, about tightness in the economy.  They don\u2019 t really reflect that.  I mean , a good example is financial services, which is really done off of asset prices, and that just \u2014so that, that\u2019s how that inflation works . So the overall picture, the story of why inflation should be coming down, is still intact . In particular , the labor market \u2014look at the labor market .  It\u2019s, it is cooler by so many measures now\u2014modestly cooler than it was in 2019, a year when inflation was well under 2 percent .  So it\u2019s not a  source of inflationary pressures .  Not to say there aren \u2019t regional and , and, you know, particular professions where labor is tight .  But , overall, you\u2019 re not getting inflationary impulses of any significance from the labor market. So what \u2019s the story?  The story is still just, we \u2019re unwinding from these large shocks that the economy got in 2021 and \u2019 22 in, for example, housing services, and now also in, in insurance , in particular, where costs went up, and those are now being reflected later in housing insurance .  It\u2019s real inflation, but it doesn\u2019 t portend persistently high inflation .  So we and most other forecasters still feel that we \u2019re on track to , you know, to get down to 2 percent .  It might\n\nDecember 18 , 2024   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\ntake another year or two from here, but I, I \u2019m confident that that\u2019 s the path we \u2019re on.  And, you know, our policy will do everything it can to assure that that is the case. MICHELLE SMITH.  Colby. COLBY SMITH.  Thank you.  Colby Smith with the Financial Times .  So the unemployment rate as of November, while still very low, is within spitting distance of the level that generated a lot of concern about the labor market over the summer in the lead -up to the 50 basis point cut in September .  Hiring has also narrowed to just a handful of sectors .  But now the Committee appears comfortable skipping cuts at upcoming meetings .  So what has changed about the Committee \u2019s assessment of the risks confronting the labor market?  Is there just less concern now on that front , or is  it just about there being more upside risk to inflation that now needs to be accounted for? CHAIR POWELL.  The , the unemployment rate has  now \u2014is now  the same as it was in July:   4.2 percent .  It\u2019s moved up and down, but it \u2019s now the same as July .  And job creation is , is lower than it has been, but it \u2019s been \u2014it\u2019 s been  steady \u2014it\u2019s not \u2014it\u2019s not  declining .  It\u2019s been steady at a level which, as I pointed out a couple times, is actually below the level that would hold the unemployment rate constant , but it \u2019s not so far below .  So, you might \u2014you might \u2014if, if we have the , the breakeven level right, and if jobs continue \u2014job creation continues at that level in the establishment survey, then you would get a tenth maybe every other month kind of thing.  So gradually declining.  But we don\u2019 t have that kind of precision in this . So, but you\u2019 re right, though, and I , I read out some of the reasons .  We, we do think the labor market is still cooling by many measures, and we \u2019re watching that closely .  It\u2019s, it\u2019s not cooling in a \u2014in a  quick or in a way that really raises concerns.  I think , you know, you pointed out participants in the FOMC really thought that the risks and uncertainty had improved relative\n\nDecember 18 , 2024   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nto the labor market.  And it \u2019s because of, because things have just gotten a little bit better, it doesn\u2019 t\u2014the unemployment rate flat and things like that.  Nonetheless, you know, we \u2019re watching it closely. COLBY SMITH.  If, if  the idea , though, is that no additional kind of softening in the labor market is welcome here, what \u2019s to prevent that from happening if rates are still restrictive? CHAIR POWELL.  So I \u2014what I said is, we don \u2019t think we need further softening to get to 2 percent inflation .  That \u2019s what I \u2019m saying, n ot that it \u2019s not welcome.   We don\u2019 t need it , we don\u2019t think .  If, if you had a situation where inflation\u2019 s moving around by a tenth every few months, that \u2019s, you know, we \u2019d have to weigh that against the fact that inflation has in recent months been moving sideways in the 12- month window .  And so we \u2019ve got to weigh them both, at this point.   You know, for a while there we were only really focused mainly, mainly focused on, on inflation.  We\u2019 ve now gotten to a place where , where the risks of the two are what we think are broadly, roughly in ba lance.  And so that \u2019s how we think about it. MICHELLE SMITH .  Steve. STEVE LIESMAN .  Mr. Chairman, I , I did not hear you use the word \u201c recalibration \u201d today.  And I \u2019m just wondering if the recalibration phase is over and what you might call this new phase and whether the criteria for changing rates is somehow different and higher than it was before.  Thanks. CHAIR POWELL .  We\u2019 re not \u2014we \u2019re not renaming the phase \u2014yet .  But we may get around to that .  But , no, I, I would say we, we are, though, in , in a new phase in the process, as I said.  So, and that \u2019s just because we\u2019 ve reduced \u2014we \u2019ve reduced our policy rate by 100 basis points .  We \u2019re significantly closer to neutral.  We still think where we are is meaningfully , meaningfully restrictive, and I think from this point forward , you know, it\u2019 s appropriate to move\n\nDecember 18 , 2024   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\ncautiously and look for progress on inflation.  We\u2019ve, you know, we\u2019ve  done a lot to support economic activity by cutting 100 basis points , and that \u2019s a good thing.  I, I think it would\u2014I support the decision, and , and I think it was the right decision to make .  I think from now we are in a place where the risks really  are in balance , and we need to see progress on inflation.  And that\u2019s, that \u2019s how we \u2019re thinking about it .  So it is kind of a new thing.  We moved pretty quickly to get to here , and I think going forward, obviously, we \u2019re going to be moving slower , which is consistent with , with  the SEP. STEVE LIESMAN .  Wonder if I could follow  up and ask you how much you or the Committee are looking through some of the high numbers we \u2019ve had in the recent inflation numbers .  For example, cars being up maybe because of the hurricanes, eggs because of the avian flu, that , that  kind of stuff .  And , and then looking forward, perhaps , to housing inflation coming down, as it did in the recent report. CHAIR POWELL .  So we, yeah, we always try to be careful about not throwing out the numbers we don\u2019 t like, you know?  It \u2019s just a, an occupational hazard is , is to [say] , \u201cLook, those high months are wrong.\u201d   What about the low months?  You know, w e\u2019ve got, we have a very low month, potentially, in November .  You know, i t\u2019s estimated by many to be in the mid- teens for core PCE .  So that could be idiosyncratically low .  We try to look\u2014 we try to look at not just a couple or three months .  We shouldn\u2019 t have \u2014our , our position shouldn\u2019 t change based on two or three months of good or bad data .  We have a long string now of inflation coming down gradually over time .  As I mentioned, 12- month, I think it \u2019s 12-month headline \u2019s 2\u00bd; 12-month core is 2.8.  That\u2019s way better than we were.  We still have some work to do , though, is how we\u2019re looking at it.  And w e need policy to remain restrictive to , to get \u2014to get that work done , we think.\n\nDecember 18 , 2024   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nMICHELLE SMITH .  Neil. NEIL IRWIN .  Thanks Chair, Chair Powell .  Neil Irwin from Axios .  Financial markets have been very buoyant , really all year .  Is the Committee comfortable with where financial conditions are , or do you see a risk that looseness in financial conditions could undermine progress on your inflation target? CHAIR POWELL .  So we , we do look carefully at financial conditions , of course ; that\u2019s part of what we do.  But, you know, we, we really look carefully at is the performance of our \u2014 of our  goal variables and , and how are we affecting the economy .  So what we \u2019ve seen over the course of \u2014just take the last year .  We, we\u2019ve seen inflation \u2014well, over the last couple of years\u2014come down a lot .  We\u2019 ve seen the labor market cool off quite a bit.  That suggests that our policy is restrictive . We\u2019ve, w e can also look more directly at , at the parts of the economy that are affected by\u2014that, that are interest sensitive, like particularly housing.  Housing activity is , is very low, and that \u2019s partly , significantly because of our policy.  So we think our policy is working.  I t\u2019s transmitting , and it \u2019s having the effects o n our goal variables that we would want .  You know, a lot of things move financial conditions around, as you know , and we don\u2019 t really control those . But I \u2019d say we , we see the effects we \u2019re hoping to see on, on the goal variables and , and the places where we\u2019 d expect to see it. NEIL IRWIN .  So, if I may, speaking of assets that have\u2014that have  been buoyant, do you see any value or benefit in the U.S. government building a reserve of Bitcoin? CHAIR POWELL .  So, you know, we, we \u2019re not allowed to own B itcoin .  The Federal Reserve Act says what we can own , and we\u2019re, we\u2019re not looking for a , a law change.  That \u2019s the kind of thing for Congress to consider, but we are not looking for a law change at the Fed.\n\nDecember 18 , 2024   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nMICHELLE SMITH .  Andrew. ANDREW ACKERMAN.  Hey, happy holidays , Mr. Chairman .  Thanks for taking our questions .  I was wondering if you are satisfied with the way 2024 is ending, if you\u2019 re confident that we \u2019ve avoided the recession that forecasters were predicting as inevitable a couple years ago. CHAIR POWELL .  I think it \u2019s pretty clear we\u2019 ve avoided a recession .  I think growth this year has , has been solid, it really has .  PDFP, private domestic f inal p urchases, which , which we think is the best indicator of private demand , is looking to come in around 3 percent  [real growth] this year .  This is a really good number .  Again, the U.S. economy has just been remarkable .  And it \u2019s\u2014when we, in these international meetings that I attend, this has been the story , is that how well the U.S. is doing.  And if you look around the world, there \u2019s just a lot of slow growth and continu ed struggle s with inflation .  So I feel \u2014I feel very good about where the economy is and the performance of the economy, and we want to keep that going. ANDREW ACKERMAN.  The other thing I just wanted to ask about was the \u2014you, you guys have noted that the unemployment rate is , is still low .  However , employment rates have fallen rather quickly .  The prime -age employment rate has fell by about half a point \u2014half a percent , rather\u2014recently .  The question, I guess , is, do you think there \u2019s maybe more downside momentum in the labor market than the unemployment rate alone is signaling? CHAIR POWELL .  I don\u2019 t think so, no.  I think , overall , if you look at it, prime -age participation is still very high .  What, w hat\u2019s going on in the labor market is that the hiring rate is low.  So if you\u2014if you have a job , you \u2019re doing very well, and layoffs are very low, right?  So people are not losing their jobs in large numbers, unusually large numbers .  If you are looking for a job , though, the hiring rate is low , and that \u2019s a signal of , of lower demand, and it has come\n\nDecember 18 , 2024   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\ndown.  So we look for signs like that, and that, that\u2019s clearly a sign of softening, further softening .  I didn\u2019 t mention it earlier, but I, I  think you can see a, an ongoing gradual softening in the labor market.  Again, not something we need to see to get 2 percent  inflation .  And , you know, that \u2019s part of the reason that explains why we moved ahead today with, with  our, with the action, with, with  an additional cut .  So, but you take a step back, the level of unemployment is very low \u2014again, participation is high .  Wages are at a healthy and , and ever  more sustainable level \u2014wage growth.  And so the labor market \u2014this is a good , a good labor market, and , you know, we want to keep it that way. MICHELLE SMITH .  Amara . AMARA OMEOKWE .  Thank you.  Amara Omeokwe from Bloomberg News .  I just want to put a finer point on the labor market .  Can you keep the labor market this way,  in the strong position that you have described, without further cuts?  In other words, do you still view the labor market as needing support to protect against a further cooling? CHAIR POWELL .  You know, we, w e can \u2019t know that with any tremendous certainty .  I, I will say that we think that, that  our policy balances the risks \u2014we think the risks are roughly in balance as between the two mandates, and we think the labor market is , is in solid shape .  And when I say it \u2019s softening or cooling, it \u2019s very gradual process .  You know, j ob creations are, are meaningfully positive ; wages are, you know, if anything, a little , still a bit above what would be sustainable if productivity were to revert to its longer- run trend.  If you, if you take into account the high productivity readings we \u2019ve had, then wages are already at a sustainable level relative to 2 percent  inflation . So, again, I , I don\u2019 t want to overstate the downside in the labor market, because the downsides clearly appear to have diminished.  Nonetheless, it \u2019s, it\u2019s one of our mandate goals ,\n\nDecember 18 , 2024   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nand, you know, we pay close attention to it , and it \u2019s, it\u2019s worth noting that it is still gradually cooling\u2014g radually and in an orderly way.  And , and, you know, that \u2019s, that\u2019s  how I would characterize it , and that \u2019s why we \u2019re paying careful attention. MICHELLE SMITH .  Elizabeth. ELIZABETH SCHULZE.  Thanks so much, Chair Powell .  Elizabeth Schulze from ABC News .  As you \u2019ve noted, the Fed is now forecasting higher inflation next year .  High prices are still a burden for so many households right now .  Why do you think it is that inflation is proving to be more stubborn than you\u2019 d expected? CHAIR POWELL .  You know, it, i t breaks down into a long answer , if you want, but it just has been a little bit more stubborn .  I think if you go back two or three years, many people were saying that to get this far down we would\u2019 ve had to have a , had a deep recession and , you know, high unemployment by now .  Well, that has not been the case, so , you know, the , the path down has actually been much better than many predicted.  We , we\u2019ve managed to, to have the unemployment rate remain essentially at its longer -run natural rate , while inflation has come down from \u2014you know, core PCE inflation has come down from 5.6 percent  to 2.8 percent  on a 12-month basis .  So that\u2019s, that \u2019s a pretty good outcome . Why hasn\u2019 t it come down  [more]?  One reason is that , that \u2014just a technical issue around the way we calculate housing services, and that , that  process has been slower than \u2014market rents have, are showing up more slowly in that measure than we might have thought three , two , two years ago .  So that \u2019s part of it. I think there are other, other  parts of the story, but , you know, the, the \u2014what , what  I think people are feeling right now is the effect of high prices, not high inflation.  So  we, we understand very well that prices went up by a great deal , and people really feel that .  And it \u2019s\n\nDecember 18 , 2024   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nprices of food and transportation and heating your home and things like that .  So there \u2019s tremendous pain in, in that burst of inflation that was very global.  This was everywhere in all the advanced economies at the same time.  So now we have \u2014inflation itself is way down , but people are still feeling high prices , and that is \u2014that is really what people are feeling .  The best we can do for them \u2014and that \u2019s who we work for \u2014is to get inflation back down to its target and keep it there so that people are earning , you know, big, real wage increases so that their , their wages are going up, their , their  compensation is going up faster than inflation year upon year upon year .  And that \u2019s what will restore people \u2019s good feeling about the economy.  That\u2019s what it will take, and that \u2019s what we \u2019re aiming for. ELIZABETH SCHULZE.  And as we look ahead to next year, what do you see as the biggest challenge to the economy under the next Administration? CHAIR POWELL .  I feel\u2014I feel very good about where the economy is , and, honestly, I\u2019m very optimistic about , about  the economy, and it \u2019s\u2014we \u2019re, we\u2019re  in a really good place ; our policy \u2019s in a really good place .  I, I expect another good year next year. MICHELLE SMITH .  Edward. EDWARD LAWRENCE .  Thanks , Chair Powell, for doing the  questions .  Edward Lawrence from F ox Business.  So you say that we \u2019re closer to the neutral rate.  What percent do you see , and the Committee believes \u2014where is that neutral rate? CHAIR POWELL .  So I \u2019ll say a couple things .  First of all, when we , when we write \u2014 the thing we write down in the Summary of Economic Projections is the longer -run neutral rate, which is the neutral rate at a time when supply and demand are in balance, the full economy \u2019s in balance, and no shocks are hitting the economy.  That is not where we are right now .  So when we\u2019re making monetary policy at the Fed, that \u2019s not the question we \u2019re asking.  So you can\u2019 t do a\n\nDecember 18 , 2024   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nstraight read between those longer -run numbers that we write down and what we think the appropriate policy should be .  So, basically, at any given time, various shocks are hitting the economy.  And so what we \u2019re doing in, in real  time is we \u2019re looking at our policy stance , and we\u2019re looking at the way it\u2019 s hitting the economy,  and, particularly , we look at the effects it \u2019s having as we try to move the economy toward maximum employment and price stability. And the answer can be  that there are things that affect the economy that are \u2014that are lasting but not permanent .  And the , the ones that are permanent are the ones that would be in r *. The ones that are, could be lasting, but , but nonetheless go away over time, they could actually affect what, what \u2019s sort of technically the appropriate neutral stance in near  term.  So we \u2019re looking at that , and, you know, we  don\u2019t \u2014we don \u2019t know exactly where it is, but as I like to say, we know it by its works, and I think what , what  we know for sure is that we \u2019re 100 basis points closer to it right now .  There are many estimates of where that might be , and we know we \u2019re a lot closer to it , and I think we \u2019re in a good place .  But I think from here it \u2019s a new phase, and we \u2019re going to be , you know, cautious about , about  further cuts. EDWARD LAWRENCE .  But , but I think that the markets are looking for, for  a little more clarity .  I mean , I\u2019ve heard estimates from 2.9  percent  to 4 percent .  You know, I, I think the markets would like to see a little more clarity about a year out, 18 months out, as to where that, that goalpost , for lack of a better term, is, because at the moment , it looks big. CHAIR POWELL .  Yeah, I mean , honestly, we \u2014you know, there are countless models of what \u2014of what  a neutral rate might be at any given time .  There , there  are empirical models, there are theoretical models, there are things that combine them, and they have as many different answers as you \u2019d like .  So there is no real certainty .  And, I mean , it\u2019s,  it\u2019s actually a good thing to know that we don\u2019 t know exactly where it is , so you\u2019 re not \u2014you\u2019 re not tempted to think, \u201cOh,\n\nDecember 18 , 2024   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nI think this model or this estimate is right. \u201d  You , you just have to be open to, you know, the empirical data that are coming in and also how it \u2019s affecting the outlook.  And it \u2019s not made any easier by the fact that , you know, that our policy works with long and variable lags . Nonetheless, that is the job we have , and so we \u2019re, we\u2019re \u2014 I think we need\u2014 i t\u2019s appropriate for us \u2014for us  now to proceed cautiously, now that we \u2019re 100 basis points closer to , to neutral, and we \u2019ll do so.  Meanwhile, the economy seems to be in , in good shape , and these cuts will certainly help to support economic activity and the labor market while we can still make progress on inflation, because policy is still meaningfully restrictive. MICHELLE SMITH .  Victoria. VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi, Victoria Guida with Politico .  I just wanted to make sure I understood what you were saying at the beginning about inflation.  Are you saying that progress on core PCE counts as progress on inflation even if headline inflation ticks up?  And then also, since that \u2019s what \u2019s projected in the SEP, I was wondering, what accounts for that?  Why , why do you all see core PCE going down and, potentially , headline inflation ticking up? CHAIR POWELL .  So, and as , as I imagine you know, the , you know, the  goal overall is headline inflation, because that \u2019s what people experience.  People don\u2019 t experience core inflation ; they experience inflation, a nd that includes food and energy costs .  So that \u2019s the overall goal.  But, as we know, headline inflation contains energy and food, and those prices can fluctuate for reasons that are not related to tightness in the economy and therefore are not really good predictors of future inflation.  So it tu rns out that core inflation  is, is a better predictor of overall inflation than overall inflation is .  So we look at core inflation because it \u2019s a better measure of what future inflation is like to be, likely to be , because it \u2019s a better measure of , of\n\nDecember 18 , 2024   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nwhat inflation pressures exist .  So that \u2019s, that\u2019s \u2014it\u2019 s complicated, but ultimately , we, you know, our goal is headline, not core .  So your question was, your second question was what? VICTORIA GUIDA.  Why do you all see core going down but headline potentially ticking up? CHAIR POWELL .  So headline can be affected \u2014you\u2019 re talking about next year. VICTORIA GUIDA.  Mm -hmm . CHAIR POWELL .  Yeah, so headline can, again, it can be affected by energy prices and food prices .  So that, there, there will be things in , in the headline forecast s that are to do with forecasts of energy prices, w hereas core will be \u2014if, if you look at core going out a full year, then it \u2019ll be much more driven by things like tightness in the economy.  So it\u2014that, that \u2019s why the two can go in different directions .  Headline has been lower, as you know, most of this year , but that \u2019s because energy prices hav e been coming down, w hich is a great thing for people .  But energy prices will come down, and then they will go up, and it won\u2019 t really be telling us anything about how tight the economy is and how, how future inflation will perform. VICTORIA GUIDA.  Do geopolitical risks factor in at all to how you\u2019 re thinking about energy prices? CHAIR POWELL .  So w e, we monitor geopolitical risks really quickly, but , you know, but\u2014really carefully , rather .  But, you know, I would say so far those risks haven \u2019t really \u2014 nothing has come out of those risks that really, has really been important for the United States economy.  The single thing that you would look to is the price of oil, given that we \u2019re talking about the Middle East and Ukraine, and, you know, and\u2014but that , that  is a good summary statistic for the kind of thing that could go wrong in, in, with global turmoil .  But the price of oil\u2019s been coming down, and, for , because of supply conditions, global supply conditions .  So we\n\nDecember 18 , 2024   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\ndon\u2019t\u2014the U.S. is not feeling, really , the effects of geopolitical turmoil,  but we are at, certainly , at a time of elevated geopolitical turmoil.  A nd it remains , you know, a risk. MICHELLE SMITH .  Kelly. KELLY O \u2019GRADY.  Thanks , Chair Powell .  Kelly O \u2019Grady from CBS News .  I want to go back to something that you said a minute ago, that wage growth is outpacing inflation now .  It wasn \u2019t the case for some time , of course .  It\u2019s partly why Americans haven \u2019t felt much relief in their wallets from prices yet.  But with inflation ticking up, how worried are you the progress in closing that gap could go away? CHAIR POWELL .  Yeah , so inflation \u2014again, we don\u2019 t overreact to a couple of months of higher readings or a couple months of lower readings .  And we,  what we ha d was \u2014we had four months of really nice readings , and then September and October were higher, but then November is much lower .  So I don\u2019 t really think the public is experiencing that as a surprising upside risk to inflation.  I, I think inflation is much lower.  What the public is feeling , and they\u2019 re right about it, is that prices are , are just\u2014the p rice level went up , because of the past inflation .  It is going to take some time  to, for real wages to recover , over a period of years in which your , your real compensation is growing .  And, in other words, your compensation\u2019 s growing meaningfully faster than inflation .  That \u2019s exactly the kind of economy we have now , and we just want to hold onto it .  That , that  process will probably take some years, but that\u2019s, that\u2019s what \u2019s going on right now .  And I don\u2019 t think that , you know, a, a couple of months of higher inflation really signal that , anything of the nature you\u2019 re suggesting. KELLY O \u2019GRADY.  And just one follow -up:  Let\u2019s look more long- term.  You previously predicted hitting the 2 percent  inflation target in 2026 .  It\u2019s now been pushed out to\n\nDecember 18 , 2024   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\n2027.  You said you\u2019 re focused on enabling further progress on inflation .  That\u2019s not necessarily progress in the right direction .  Are you confident that target isn \u2019t going to move further out? CHAIR POWELL .  We\u2019 re talking about \u2014when you\u2019 re projecting the economy, you know, three years out, two years out, you\u2019 re talking about high uncertainty.  Very high uncertainty.  You know, we, w e really \u2014at that point it, it \u2019s not, it \u2019s not possible to confidently predict where the economy is going to be in three years .  So what we \u2019re doing is we \u2019re looking at what \u2019s happening now .  And we \u2019re kind of projecting that the same kinds of things are happening \u2014so we, we keep a strong labor market, housing services inflation comes down, goods and services \u2014goods inflation settles down, and, you know, nonmarket services return to their, their prior level.  A ll of those things should happen over time , and, and, you know, those pieces come together .  There\u2019s every reason to think that they will .  The timing of it is highly uncertain . You know, but you\u2019 re not wrong, though, that , you know, we \u2019ve, the \u2014 it\u2019s been a bit frustrating because the \u2014while we \u2019ve made progress, it has been slower than we had hoped . Nonetheless, we \u2019re still on track .  And, you know, I think if you\u2019d \u2014if two, two  years ago , you\u2019 d said, \u201cwe were [going to be] at 4.2 percent  unemployment and 2.8 percent  inflation,\u201d  people would be, would say, \u201c I\u2019ll take that.\u201d   I mean , that, that \u2019s a pretty good interim place to be .  Job\u2019 s not done , but, but I think we \u2019re, we\u2019re  feeling good about where we are and where we \u2019re headed. MICHELLE SMITH .  Go to Nancy for the last question. NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Nancy Marshall -Genzer from Marketplace .  You said a couple times, inflation has been moving sideways .  You know, i t appears to be settling in around, excuse me, 2\u00bd percent .  Do you think the Fed is just going to have to settle for that and accept that you \u2019re not going to get to your 2 percent  target?\n\nDecember 18 , 2024   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nCHAIR POWELL .  No, we \u2019re not going to settle for that.  I think we \u2019re, we\u2019re, you know, we certainly have every intention and expectations  that we \u2019ll get inflation back sustainably to 2 percent .  That is \u2014and I am confident we will achieve that .  It has taken longer, but it \u2019s, you have to be \u2014you know, we are making progress.  W e have made a great deal of progress .  And we \u2019ll continue to do so and get back to 2 percent  inflation .  That \u2019s what we owe the public .  And, and, you know, we \u2019re committed to achieving it. NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  In that case, can you rule out a rate hike next year? CHAIR POWELL .  You don\u2019 t rule things completely in or out in this \u2014in this  world . That doesn\u2019 t appear to be a likely outcome.  I think we \u2019re at 4.3 percent .  That\u2019s, t hat\u2019s meaningfully restrictive , and I , I think it\u2019 s a well -calibrated rate for us to continue to make progress on inflation while , while  keeping a , a strong labor market . So\u2014Thank you very much."

    "text": "January 29, 2025   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nTranscript of Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference January 29, 2025\n\nCHAIR POWELL .  Good afternoon .  My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on achieving our dual -mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of the American people .  The economy is strong\u2014is strong  overall and has made significant progress toward our goals over the past two years .  Labor market conditions have cooled from their formerly overheated state and remain solid.  Inflation has moved much closer to our 2\u202fpercent longer -run goal, though it remains somewhat elevated. In support of our goals, today the Federal Open Market Committee decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings .  I\u2019ll have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments . Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace . For 2024 as a whole, GDP looks to have risen above  2 percent, bolstered by resilient consumer spending.  Investment in equipment and intangibles appears to have slowed in the fourth quarter but was strong for the year overall .  Following weakness in the middle of last year, activity in the housing sector seems to have stabilized . In the labor market, conditions remain solid .  Payroll job gains averaged 170,000 per month over the past three months .  Following earlier increases, the unemployment rate has stabilized since the middle of last year and , at 4.1 percent in December, remains low .  Nominal wage growth has eased over the past year, and the jobs- to-workers gap has narrowed .  Overall, a wide set of indicators suggests that conditions in the labor market are broadly in balance .  The labor market is not a source of significant inflationary pressures . Inflation has eased significantly over the past two years but remains somewhat elevated relative to our 2 percent longer -run goal .  Estimates based on the c onsumer price i ndex and other\n\nJanuary 29, 2025   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\ndata indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.6 percent over the 12\u202fmonths ending in December and that, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent . Longer -term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets . Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people .  We see the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals as being roughly in balance, and we are attentive to the risks on both sides of our mandate . Over the course of our three previous meetings, we lowered our policy rate by a full percentage point from its peak .  That recalibration of our policy stance was appropriate in light of the progress on inflation and the rebalancing in the labor market .  With our policy stance significantly less restrictive than it had been and the economy remaining strong, we do not need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance .  At today \u2019s meeting, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal fund s rate at 4 \u00bc to 4 \u00bd percent . We know that reducing policy restraint too fast or too much could hinder progress on inflation .  At the same time, reducing policy restraint too slowly or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment .  In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks .  We\u2019re  not on any preset course . As the economy evolves, we will adjust our policy stance in a manner that best promotes our maximum- employment and price -stability goals .  If the economy remains \u2014economy remains  strong and inflation does not continue to move sustainably toward 2 percent, we can\n\nJanuary 29, 2025   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nmaintain policy restraint for longer.  If the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated, we can ease policy accordingly.  Policy is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate . As we previously announced, our five -year review , review  of our monetary policy framework is taking place this year .  At this meeting, the Committee began its discussions by reviewing the context and outcomes of our previous review that concluded in 2020 as well as the experiences of other central banks in conducting reviews .  Our review will again include outreach and public events involving a wide range of parties, including Fed Listens events around the country and a research conference in May.  Throughout this process, we will be open to new ideas and critical feedback, and we will take on board lessons of the last five years in determining our findings .  We intend to wrap up the review by late summer .  I would note that the Committee \u2019s 2\u202fpercent longer -run inflation goal will, will  be retained and will not be a focus of the review . The Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy :  maximum employment and stable prices .  We remain committed to supporting maximum employment, bringing inflation sustainably to our 2\u202fpercent goal, and keeping longer -run inflation expectations well anchored. Our success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans.  We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country .  Everything we do is in service to our public mission.  We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals .  Thank you.  I look forward to your questions . MICHELLE SMITH .  Steve .\n\nJanuary 29, 2025   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nSTEVE LIESMAN .  Mr . Chairman, Steve Liesman from CNBC .  Mr . Chairman, al l right, at an event in Davos \u2014or from , to Davos , anyway\u2014the P resident said he\u2019ll  demand that interest rates drop immediately .  So I guess I have a three -part question.  H as the P resident done this to you?  Has he made that demand ?  Secondly, what is your response to that ?  And , third, what effect, if any thing \u2014if any , does a  President making these kind of remarks have on policy? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL .  Three questions .  I\u2019m seeing , seeing  it really as one question , though. So, I, I \u2019m not going to have \u2014I\u2019m not going to have any, any response or comment whatsoever on, on what the P resident \u2019s said.  It\u2019s not appropriate for me to do so.  The public should be confident that we will continue to do our work as we always have \u2014focusing on using our tools to achieve our goals , and really keeping our heads down and doing our work.  And that \u2019s how we best serve the public . STEVE LIESMAN .  Could you just comment on whether he \u2019s physically communicated his demand to you? CHAIR POWELL .  I\u2019ve had no contact . STEVE LIESMAN .  Thank you. CHAIR POWELL .  Thanks . MICHELLE SMITH .  Nick . NICK TIMIRAOS .  Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal .  Chair Powell, you and several of your colleagues said around the time of the last meeting that your policy stance was \u201cmeaningfully restrictive .\u201d  Given economic and financial market developments since then, how has your confidence changed in an assessment that says interest rates are meaningfully restrictive ?\n\nJanuary 29, 2025   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nCHAIR POWELL .  I don\u2019 t think that my assessment really has changed .  I mean , a couple of things have happened.  W e\u2019ve gotten more strong data, but we \u2019ve also seen rates move up at the long end, which could represent a tightening in financial conditions .  I think if we look back over the past year or so, we can see that policy is restrictive.  If you look at the effect of high rates on interest -sensitive spending \u2014for example , in housing\u2014and if you look at the achievement of our goal variables, we \u2019re seeing the economy move toward 2 percent inflation and, and has moved largely to maximum employment, so.  Though we literally look at the \u2014at the\u2014at movement toward the goal variables to make that assessment .  Now, policy is meaningfully less restrictive than it was before we beg an to cut .  It\u2019s 100 basis points less restrictive .  And for that reason, you know, we\u2019re going to be focusing on seeing real progress on inflation or, alternatively,  some weakness in the labor market before we\u2014 before we consider making adjustments . NICK TIMIRAOS .  If I could follow  up.  Does the economy here warrant meaningfully restrictive interest rates, and would you judge interest rates to still be meaningfully restrictive if you were to lower them by another \u00bc point ? CHAIR POWELL .  So, I , I think our policy stance is very well  calibrated, as I mentioned, to balance the achievement of our two\u2014of our two goals .  We, we  want to \u2014policy to be restrictive enough to continue to foster further, further progress for our 2 percent inflation goal.  At the same time, we don \u2019t need to see further weakening in the labor market to achieve that goal, and that \u2019s kind of what we \u2019ve been getting.  The labor market has really been broadly stable;  the unemployment rate has been broadly stable now for six months .  Conditions seem to be broadly in balance .  And I would say, look at the last couple of inflation readings and you see we don\u2019 t\u2014we don\u2019 t overreact to two good readings or two bad readings .  But, nonetheless, the\n\nJanuary 29, 2025   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nlast couple of readings have suggested , you know, more positive readings .  So I, I think we \u2019re\u2014I think policy \u2019s well, well positioned. MICHELLE SMITH .  Colby, from the New York Times. COLBY SMITH.  Colby Smith, with  the New York Times.  Chair Powell, how should we interpret the removal of the line from the statement that inflation has made progress towards the 2 percent goal ?  Is that no longer the case ? CHAIR POWELL .  No, so let me look \u2014if you just look at the first paragraph, we did a little bit of language cleanup there .  We took out a reference to \u201c since earlier in the year \u201d as it related to the labor market, a nd we just chose to , to shorten that sentence.  Again, I , I mean, if you look at the sort of intermeeting data was good, and, and there was\u2014there was another inflation reading, I guess , just before the December meeting .  So, we \u2019ve got two, two  good readings in a row that are consistent with 2 percent inflation .  Again, we \u2019re not going to overinterpret two good or two bad readings, but this was not meant to send a signal other than this:  You know, you, you can take away from all of this that we remain committed to achieving our 2 percent inflation goal sustainably. COLBY SMITH.  And just to follow  up:  W e\u2019ve seen inflation expectations across a number of measures rise sharply \u2014which has , in part , been linked to tariff concerns .  But there \u2019s also been this encouraging data that you mentioned in terms of CPI and rent indices .  So how would you characterize concerns about upside risks to inflation across the Committee, especially those tied to policies related to the Trump Administration ? CHAIR POWELL .  Well I, I\u2019d say you, you see expectations moving up a little bit, at the short end\u2014 but not at the longer run, which [ is] where it really matters .  And those could be related to \u2014could be related to what you mentioned, some of the new policies .  I think where the\n\nJanuary 29, 2025   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nCommittee is very much in the mode of waiting to see what policies are enacted .  We, a nd we , we don\u2019 t know what will happen with, with  tariffs, with immigration, with fiscal policy, and with regulatory policy .  We \u2019re only just beginning to see \u2014actually , are not really beginning to see much, and I think we need to\u2014we need to  let those policies be articulated before we can even begin to make a , a plausible assessment of what their implications for the economy will be .  So we\u2019re going to be watching carefully and, and, as we always do .  This is no different than any other set of policy changes at the beginning of  a\u2014of an A dministration .  We\u2019 ll patiently watch and understand and, and, you know, kind of not be in a hurry to, to get to a place of understanding what our policy response should be until we see how it plays out . MICHELLE SMITH .  Michael McKee. MICHAEL MCKEE .  Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio.  You and your colleagues normally condition future policy moves with the phrase, \u201c if the economy develops as we anticipate. \u201d  Is it fair to say that since there \u2019s a lot unknown about what this Administration \u2019s fiscal policies are actually going to be that you don\u2019 t have a medium - to long- term economic forecast that you can have confidence in?  Or, if that \u2019s not true, can you lay out what you think is going to happen in the economy, how you s ee it developing ? CHAIR POWELL .  Well, at all times \u2014at all times , forecasts are conditional, at a minimum, on just a set of expectations, and , and they\u2019 re highly uncertain in both directions .  We , we know that economic forecasting is , is really difficult, beyond just a month or two out.  So in the current situation, there \u2019s probably some elevated uncertainty because of , of, you know, significant policy shifts in those four areas that I mentioned :  tariffs, tariffs, immigration, fiscal policy, and, and regulatory policy.  So there \u2019s probably some additional uncertainty, but that should be passing;  we should go through that .  And then we \u2019ll be back to the regular amount of\n\nJanuary 29, 2025   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nuncertain .  You know, what, what forecasters are doing \u2014not just us, but everybody\u2019 s doing\u2014is they\u2019 ve got sort of just a set of assumptions about what might happen, but they \u2019re really kind of in the nature of a placeholder , and\u2014 meaning, you know, plausible, could be, but honestly you wouldn\u2019 t stand behind it because you just don\u2019 t know, and so you\u2019 re just \u2014you\u2019 re just on hold, waiting to see what comes down.  You know, i t\u2019s, it\u2019s a very large economy, and policies affect it at the margin, but we \u2019ll, you know, we \u2019re going to wait and see . MICHAEL MCKEE .  If I could follow  up.  T he idea that you feel the\u2014that policy is restrictive suggests that the Fed , in general , wants to continue to lower interest rates .  So when you look at the data that you are dependent on, are you looking for data that tell you that you can cut or data that will tell you  [that] you should hold? CHAIR POWELL .  You know, we \u2019re\u2014we\u2019re  looking\u2014it \u2019s more the other \u2014the way \u2014 the way it works is , we are looking at the data to guide us in what we should do.  And , you know, that, that\u2019s what we do .  And right now , we feel like we\u2019 re in a very good place .  Policy \u2019s well positioned.  The economy\u2019s  in, in quite a good place , actually, as well .  And what, what we do expect is to see further progress on inflation, and , you know, as I mentioned, as we see that \u2014or if we were to see weakening in the labor market that  could  foster \u2014we could then be in a position of, of making further adjustments .  But, right now , we, we don \u2019t see that, and we see things as in a really good place for policy and for the economy, and so we feel like we don\u2019 t need to be in a hurry to, to make any adjustments. MICHELLE SMITH .  Howard . HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Howard Schneider with Reuters .  Thank you very much.  In 2021, at a central bank conference, you said, quote, \u201c Throughout my career in both public and private sectors, I\u2019 ve seen that the best and most successful organizations are often  the ones that\n\nJanuary 29, 2025   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nhave a strong and persistent commitment to diversity and inclusion.  These organizations consistently attract the best talent by investing in and retaining a world -class workforce. \u201d Question, first question is, do you still believe that ?  And if so, how do you intend to put that belief into practice while remaining consistent with the recent executive order prohibiting diversity and inclusion efforts ? CHAIR POWELL .  So let me say, \u201c yes,\u201d in answer to your first question .  But, to the second question, I want to say this :  We are, like others, we\u2019re reviewing the orders and the associated details as they are made available.  A nd as has been our practice over many Administrations, we are working to align our policies with the executive orders as appropriate and consistent with applicable law .  And I want to add that I \u2019m not going to have anything more specific for you today on this whole set of issues . HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Well, if I could just follow  up quickly on that .  I\u2019m wondering how you\u2019 re getting that to be consistent with the Dodd- Frank law \u2019s stipulations about maintaining an Office of Minority and Women Inclusion . CHAIR POWELL.  So I did\u2014I did mention \u201cconsistent with applicable law, \u201d right ? HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Which is governing. MICHELLE SMITH .  Elizabeth . ELIZABETH SCHULZE.  Thanks so much.  Elizabeth Schulze with ABC News.  Just to follow  up on Steve \u2019s question, what reassurance can you give the American public that the Fed will continue to operate independent of politics under this A dministration ? CHAIR POWELL .  You know, I\u2019ve \u2014as I \u2019ve said countless times over the years, this is\u2014this is who we are ; this is what we do .  We study the data, we , we analyze how it will affect the outlook and the balance of risks, and we use our tools to try to give it our best understanding,\n\nJanuary 29, 2025   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nour best thinking, try to achieve our goals .  That \u2019s what we do ; that\u2019s always what we do .  Don \u2019t look for us to do anything else .  And that \u2019s\u2014you know, lots of research shows that \u2019s the\u2014that \u2019s the best way for a central bank to operate .  That\u2019ll give us the best possible chance to achieve these goals for the benefit of the American people .  That \u2019s always what we\u2019 re going to do.  A nd people should have confidence in that , as I \u2014as I  said a few minutes ago . ELIZABETH SCHULZE.  You \u2019ve said that the Fed is in wait- and-see mode, based on the policies that come out of this A dministration .  Has the Fed started to model what policies like mass deportations, changes in immigration policy, specifically, would look like for the workforce and for inflation ? CHAIR POWELL .  So one of the things our , our staff does is they , they look at a range of possible outcomes , and , and they, they tend to go from really good to really bad, and, you know, it\u2019 s, it\u2019s one of the best things that they do.  And i n each Tealbook \u2014you can look at the five-year-old Tealbooks and see  their  alternative simulations .  So that \u2019s what they do.  They, it\u2019 ll be a baseline, and then they\u2019 ll show six or seven alternative scenarios, including really good ones and, and not -so-good ones .  And wha t those do is they spark, you know, the, the policymakers to sort of think and understand about the, you know, the, the uncertainties that surround this .  So, yes, we, we \u2014staff does that, and we, we\u2019 re all well aware that there are \u2014that the range of possibilities is always broad , and\u2014not just now , but always .  And you have to\u2014it \u2019s hard to be open to just how , how  broad the possibilities are for an economy.  You know, no one saw the pandemic coming , and it was \u2014you know, it changed everything.  So things happen, and\u2014but yes, we do\u2014we do  do that .  But it\u2019 s, it\u2019s one thing to do that to make assessments about what might happen and begin to think about what you might do in that case, but you don\u2019 t act until you\u2014until you see much more than we see now .\n\nJanuary 29, 2025   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nMICHELLE SMITH .  Catarina. CATARINA SARAIVA.  Catarina Saraiva, Bloomberg News .  You know , last month you talked about a future rate cut as being pretty, you know, significantly predicated on more progress in inflation .  With the characterization of the labor market in the statement today, would you say that that \u2019s even more so the case now ? CHAIR POWELL .  I\u2019d say it \u2019s the same.  You know, we, w e want to see, you know, further progress on inflation .  And, you know, the story \u2019s there .  It\u2019s, it\u2019s\u2014we \u2019re just going to have to see the data.  At the end of the day, it , it comes down to 12- month inflation , because that takes out the seasonality issues that may exist .  And, you know, we \u2019re, we\u2019re  just going to need to see that .  We think that \u2014we think we see the pathway for that to happen.  One , one example \u2014a key example \u2014is that you now do see owner \u2019s equivalent rent and , you know, housing services \u2014the way it \u2019s calculated for PCE  [prices], you see that coming down pretty steadily now , and that \u2019s the\u2014that \u2019s the place where the,  most of the remaining gap is .  In addition, a big part of the overrun, as you will know, was [coming] from nonmarket services [prices], which don\u2019 t tend to send much signal  [about  future  inflation].  So you can look through all that and, and think, \u201cO kay, that then we seem to be set up for further progress .\u201d  But being seem to set up for it is one thing ; having it is another .  So we, we \u2019re going to want to see further, further progress on inflation .  Remember, we \u2019re not, you know, we\u2019re, we \u2019re under \u20142 percent, but our goal is 2 percent , and we do mean to get back sustainably to  2 percent . CATARINA SARAIVA.  And , and in terms of the labor market, I mean , how \u2014is that broadly\u2014you know, you said a broad set of indicators show that it \u2019s in pretty solid place.  Was there broad agreement on that ?  There \u2019s been a few underlying indicators that are showing\n\nJanuary 29, 2025   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nperhaps some weakness:  a low hiring rate, you know, workers reporting that it\u2019 s increasingly difficult to find a job .  Is that of concern to the Committee ? CHAIR POWELL .  So you\u2019 re right .  I mean , we look at, of course, a very broad range . And, so , it starts with unemployment \u2014sorry , with, yeah, with the unemployment rate, employment participation, wages, job quits \u2014are people quitting? \u2014that kind of thing.  The ratio of vacancies to unemployed.  We look at all those things, and you, you put your finger , though, on\u2014it\u2019 s a low \u2014it\u2019s a low -hiring environment .  So if you have a job, it \u2019s all\u2014it\u2019s all good, but if you\u2014if you have to find a job, the job- finding rate \u2014the hiring rates have come down .  And that\u2019s, that \u2019s more typical of a \u2014let\u2019s say \u2014let\u2019s say  that the unemployment \u2014that the \u2014that th e labor market is at a sustainable level .  It\u2019s not overheated anymore .  We don \u2019t think we need it to cool off anymore .  We do watch it extremely carefully .  It\u2019s one of our two goal variables .  But , yeah, I, I \u2019d say we watch those things quite carefully .  But nonetheless, overall , look at the aggregate data in the labor market.  It does seem  to\u2014the labor market does seem, seem to be pretty stable and broadly in balance .  When you\u2019 ve got a, an unemployment rate that is \u2014that has been pretty stable now for , for a, a full half a year . MICHELLE SMITH .  Edward . EDWARD LAWRENCE .  Thank you.  T hank you, Mr . Chairman .  Edward Lawrence with F ox Business.  On employment, now , you said there \u2019s a broad range of possibilities, but last September you said, quote, \u201c We understand that there \u2019s been quite an influx across the borders , and that has actually been one of things that \u2019s allowed unemployment rate to rise. \u201d  Now that the flow over the border has slowed and we \u2019re seeing deportations, how do you expect the unemployment rate to react?\n\nJanuary 29, 2025   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nCHAIR POWELL .  You know, s o what \u2019s happening is that the , the flows across the border have decreased very significantly, and there \u2019s every reason to expect that to continue . And so\u2014but job creation has come down a bit , too, so, you know, if those two things come down together, that , that  sort of can be a reason for the unemployment rate to stabilize .  In other words, a breakeven rate \u2014as, as  population growth slows, the breakeven rate that you need in new jobs to make \u2014to, to make jobs for , for workers declines as well .  So that seems to be something about  what \u2019s happening.  You, you do see a very \u2014a very flat unemployment rate at a time when you\u2019 ve seen significant declines [in job growth] . EDWARD LAWRENCE .  I want to ask you about Fed employment .  I know that tax money is not used here, but Elon Musk alleges that the Fed is,  quote, \u201c absurdly overstaffed. \u201d We\u2019ve seen the Executive Branch push to reduce the federal workforce .  I just want to get your reaction . CHAIR POWELL .  You know, we, w e run a very careful budget process where we \u2019re fully aware that  what, that, you know, we owe the \u2014we owe that to the public , and we believe we do that .  I, I\u2019ve got no further comment than that, thanks. MICHELLE SMITH .  Chris . CHRIS RUGABER.  Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.  President Trump has said he will lower inflation by reducing gas and energy costs .  Do you see such costs as a particular driver of inflation , and would lowering them have a dramatic effect ? CHAIR POWELL .  Chris, I \u2019m not going to\u2014I \u2019m not going to react or discuss anything that, that  any elected politician might say .  So I \u2019ll give you a mulligan. CHRIS RUGABER.  Okay, oh, thank you.  Well, nearly two weeks ago the Fed said it was withdrawing from the Network for Greening the Financial System even as,  you know, even\n\nJanuary 29, 2025   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nas we have significant wildfires in Los Angeles doing billions of dollars in damage .  And , of course, the NGFS, as you know, is a group to talk about how the financial system could address climate change.  Many commentators did see the timing as political.  Why did you leave that organization ?  Can you explain that decision? CHAIR POWELL .  Sure, I \u2019d be glad to.  So we considered this , you know, really at length, and we did decide to withdraw from the NGFS .  And, really , the reason is that the, the work that the NGFS does has broadened very significantly.  Think about nature -related risks and biodiversity and things like that .  In addition, the , the work of the NGFS is , is, in, in significant part intended to\u2014and this is a quote \u2014\u201cmobilize mainstream finance to support the transition toward a sustainable economy. \u201d  So we joined t o get the benefit of understanding what other central banks were doing and , and seeing research and things like that .  I think this is just way beyond any plausible mandate that you could attribute to the Fed, and so we have a quite narrow role, as I \u2019ve\u2014as I\u2019ve said many times, and I think that , that  the activities of the NGFS are not a good fit for the Fed, given our current mandate and authority.  So, you know , and I just think it was time to acknowledge that .  You know, the, t he process \u2014this process dates back \u2014thinking about it dates back a couple of years .  I made the decision to bring this to the Board , you know, some months ago .  It just\u2014it just\u2014 the process just took time to get here, and, and this is when \u2014 this is when we , we got in and voted on it, so.  A nd I\u2019m aware of how it can look, but it was really not driven by politics ; it was driven by kind of the disconnect between the work of the NGFS and our mandate .  Other central banks have different mandates and belong to the NGFS . We have no, no  criticism of them.  B ut it just isn \u2019t\u2014it\u2019s not right for the Fed. MICHELLE SMITH .  Andrew .\n\nJanuary 29, 2025   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nANDREW ACKERMAN.  Th anks.  Andrew Ackerman with the Washington Post .  I\u2019m wondering if you could talk more about what further progress would look like for consumers . CHAIR POWELL .  Well, 2 percent \u2014inflation down to\u2014inflation down to 2 percent sustainably is what , what  we\u2019re trying to achieve .  You know, we\u2019re, w e\u2019re somewhat above that, as you know, and, you know, we, we want to see, you know, serial readings that suggest that we\u2019re making further progress on inflation .  That \u2019s what we want to see.  And consumers will, will pick that up, of course , in the things that they buy at the grocery store or at the store . ANDREW ACKERMAN.  The other thing I wanted to ask was just how far away you think you are from neutral . CHAIR POWELL .  Yeah, you can\u2019 t know with any precision, of course .  As I like to say, that you know that \u2014you know the neutral rate by its works .  So I think, you know, at 4.3 percent we\u2019re, we\u2019re  above pretty much everyone on the Committee \u2019s estimates of the longer -run neutral .  I think our eyes are telling us that our policy is having the effects on the economy. That\u2019s really the question we ask .  You know, you can consult models, empirical models, theoretical models .  You really have to just look out the  window and see how your \u2014how your policy rate is affecting the economy.  And I think we see that it\u2019 s having meaningful effects in bringing inflation under control .  It has helped bring the labor market into balance as well .  So that\u2019s what we think.  I , I would say we \u2019re meaningfully above it .  I, I am\u2014I, I have no illusion that, that  anyone knows precisely how much that is .  And , but it, you know \u2014not knowing that, and having cut 100 basis points, means that it \u2019s appropriate that we \u2014that we not be in a hurry to make further adjustments . MICHELLE SMITH .  Victoria .\n\nJanuary 29, 2025   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nVICTORIA GUIDA.  Victoria Guida with Politico .  So, as a general matter, when it comes to executive orders and OMB memos, do those always apply to the Fed, sometimes, never, or do you just often voluntarily comply?  What is\u2014what is  the legality there ? CHAIR POWELL .  So it \u2019s been \u2014it\u2019s been  our practice, as I mentioned, to work to align our policies to those that are mentioned in, in the executive orders .  And that \u2019s\u2014I\u2019m just going to leave it at that .  As I mentioned, I \u2019m not going to\u2014I \u2019m not going to go any deeper than that or, or get into any deeper into this set of issues today . MICHELLE SMITH .  Claire. CLAIRE JONES .  Claire Jones from the Financial Times .  Two questions , if I may , on tariffs .  Well , first of all, we \u2019ve seen global trade wars before, notably in 2019 last time around. But then we were then in a very different place on both inflation and growth.  If we see tariffs of the same sort of magnitude that we got then \u2014which I  know is a big if \u2014what do you think might be different this time around ?  And , secondly, Tiff Macklem said there was no doubt that the threat of tariffs was a big driver of the  cut by the Bank of Canada today.  What sort of information would the Fed need to see on tariffs before it was willing to take such a preemptive move ?  Thank you. CHAIR POWELL .  Sorry , make a \u2014? CLAIRE JONES .  To\u2014what sort of information would you need to see on tariffs ? Would you need to see a strategy, a ctual implementation , actual movement of inflation expectations , before you \u2019re actually willing  to change the path of monetary policy on the basis of it? CHAIR POWELL .  So we just \u2014so first of all, thing, things are a little different now . We\u2019ve just come through a high- inflation period, and you can argue that both ways .  You can\u2014\n\nJanuary 29, 2025   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nyou can say that companies have figured out that they do like to raise prices, but , but we also hear a lot from companies these days that consumers have really had it with price increases, and so I don\u2019 t know how that shakes out .  Nonetheless, you\u2019 re coming through a situation where we\u2019re not quite back to 2 percent, and that, that\u2019s just different. In addition, you know, the trade \u2014the kind of footprint of trade  is, has changed a, a  lot, as trade is now spread around the , you know \u2014it\u2019 s not as concentrated in China as it was .  There was a lot more manufacturing .  It moved to Mexico and other places .  So, so there were differences, and I just think the , the range of possibilities is , is very, very wide .  We just don \u2019t know , and I , I don\u2019 t want to start speculating, as tempting as it is, because we really don \u2019t know . And we didn\u2019 t know, by the way, in, I guess,  2018.  Yeah, we didn\u2019 t really know .  And it, you know, the \u2014again, the range of possibilities , very, very wide .  We don\u2019 t know what \u2019s going to be tariff.  We don \u2019t know for how long or how much, what countries .  We don \u2019t know about retaliation .  We don\u2019 t know how it \u2019s going to transmit through the economy to consumers . That\u2019s, that really does remain to be seen .  You know, t here are lots of places where that \u2014where that\u2014where that price increase from the tariff can show up between the manufacturer and a consumer .  Just so many variables.  So we \u2019re just going to have to wait and see .  And, you know, the best we can do is what we\u2019 ve done, which is study up on this and, you know, look at historical experience, read the literature, and think about the factors that might matter, and then we\u2019ll just have to see \u2014have to see how it \u2014how it  goes . MICHELLE SMITH .  Courtenay. COURTENAY BROWN.  Thank you.  Courtenay Brown from Axios .  Two unrelated questions .  The first is whether or not there was any discussion about QT and the timeline for ending QT at this meeting .  And then the second question is just \u2014I wonder if the AI -prompted\n\nJanuary 29, 2025   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nselloff in the stock market this week signaled anything to you about the state of financial conditions . CHAIR POWELL .  So, on Q T, on\u2014 let\u2019s,  let\u2019s talk about runoff .  So the most recent data do suggest that reserves are still abundant .  Reserves remain roughly as high as they were when runoff began.  And the f ederal f unds r ate has been very steady  within the target range .  We track a, a bunch of metrics , and they do tend to point to, to reserves being abundant .  We do intend to reduce the size of our balance sheet to a level that \u2019s consistent with implementing monetary policy efficiently and effectively in our ample -reserves regime.  We\u2019 re closely monitoring a, a range of indicators to assess conditions , and that should provide signals whether reserves are approaching a level that could be judged as, quote, \u201c somewhat above ample. \u201d  I, I don\u2019t have anything to say to you about particular dates ; it\u2019s just that \u2019s the process, and what we see is, is that, that  rates do appear to be abundant .  As always, we stand ready to take appropriate action to support the smooth transition of monetary policy, including to adjust the details of our approach for reducing the size of the balance sheet in light of economic and financial developments . On, on AI, it\u2019 s a big event in , in the stock market and in particular parts of the stock market.  I mean , what, what really matters for us is macro developments , and that means substantial changes in financial conditions that are persistent for a period of time .  So I wouldn\u2019 t put that label on, on these events, although of course we \u2019re all watching it with interest. MICHELLE SMITH .  Simon . SIMON RABINOVITCH.  Simon Rabinovitch with t he Economist , thank you.  You mentioned in your remarks that activity in the housing sector seems to have stabilized.  At the same time, since your first rate cut in September, long -term mortgage rates have gone up by a full percentage point, back above 7 percent .  I\u2019m w ondering, kind of looking forward, do you\n\nJanuary 29, 2025   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nthink\u2014are you confident that activity will remain stable, given how elevated mortgage rates are ? How does it fit into your broader thinking about the economy ? CHAIR POWELL .  So, as you know, as we \u2019ve reduced our , our policy rate 100 basis points, longer rates have gone up.  Not because of expectations\u2014not principally because of expectations about our policy or about inflation;  it\u2019s more a term premium story .  So, and, you know, it\u2019 s long rates that matter for, for  housing.  So I, I don\u2019 t think \u2014I think these higher rates are going to \u2014they\u2019 re, they\u2019re  probably hold back housing activities to some extent , if they \u2019re persistent .  We\u2019ll have to see how long they persi st.  So, you know, we, we are\u2014we control an overnight rate .  Generally , it, it  propagates through the whole family of asset prices, including interest rates .  But in this particular case, it\u2019 s all happened at a time when , for reasons unrelated to our policy, longer rates have moved up. MICHELLE SMITH .  Jennifer . JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.  Thank you, Chair Powell.  Jennifer Schonberger with Yahoo Finance .  You said you want to see further progress on inflation.  Given that households appear to be unhappy with the elevated level of prices, do you believe the Committee should wait until inflation has fallen back to target to cut rates again ? CHAIR POWELL .  No, I wouldn\u2019 t say that .  We, w e\u2019ve never said we need to be all the way at target to reduce rates.  At , at any time , what we \u2019re doing is we \u2019re looking at the economy and asking whether our policy stance is the right one to achieve maximum employment and price stability .  So I, I think if \u2014we would want to see further progress , but we think our \u2014we think our\u2014as I mentioned, we think that our policy stance is restrictive .  Meaningfully restrictive .  Not highly restrictive, but meaningfully restrictive .  And so I would think we need to see fur ther\n\nJanuary 29, 2025   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nprogress .  I wouldn\u2019 t say all the way back down to 2 percent on a sustainable basis, although we\u2019d love to see that, of course, and we will . JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.  And a separate question for you, on tariffs .  Curious whether the threat of tariffs and not knowing whether they could stick or not creates uncertainty for business here in the United States and could cause them to pull back, ultimately weighing on growth.  Does the threat of tariffs cause you to ponder your growth forecast ? CHAIR POWELL .  You know, w e\u2014I want to avoid commenting, even indirectly, on the conduct of tariffs .  You know, i t\u2019s not our job, and it \u2019s not our job to comment on the moves that people make .  So I , I wouldn\u2019 t want to criticize anything that \u2019s happening or really comment on it one way or another \u2014praise it , for that matter.  It \u2019s just not our job . I do think that \u2014you know, we found in, in 2018, [when]  there was a lot of work done on trade policy uncertainty , trade policy uncertainty, if it \u2019s large and persistent, can start to matter for businesses making investment decisions and things like that .  That \u2019s not something I \u2019m observing today.  It\u2019 s very early days for this.  B ut that did \u2014I think that did matter in 2018 \u201319. And, and it\u2019 s one, you know, one of many things we \u2019ll be watching . MICHELLE SMITH .  Matt  Egan . MATT EGAN .  Thank you, Chair Powell.  Matt Egan from CNN .  Following up on Courtenay\u2019 s question from earlier about the stock market, how concerned are you, if at all, about potential asset bubble brewing in financial markets ?  How do relatively high market valuations factor into considerations about potentially lowering interest rates further?  Is that something that\u2019s in the back of your mind? CHAIR POWELL .  So we , we look\u2014we  look at , from a financial stability perspective , at asset prices generally, along with things like leverage in the household sector, leverage in the\n\nJanuary 29, 2025   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nbanking system, funding risk for banks, and things like that .  But it \u2019s just one of the four things, asset prices are.  And , yeah, I, I \u2019d say they\u2019 re elevated by , by many metrics right now .  A good part of that, of course, is this thing around tech and AI, but we , we look at that .  But , you know, we also \u2014we look at how resilient the households and, and businesses and the financial sector are to those things .  So we look at that mainly from our financial stability perspective , and we think that there \u2019s a lot  of resilience out there .  Banks have high capital, and households are actually, overall \u2014not all households , but in, in  the aggregate, households are in pretty good shape financially these days .  So that \u2019s how we think about that .  I, you know, w e, we also\u2014we look at overall financial conditions, and you\u2019 ve got \u2014you can\u2019 t just take \u2014you can \u2019t just take equity prices.  Y ou\u2019ve got to look at rates , too, and that, you know, that represents a, a tightening in conditions , with higher rates .  So, overall , financial conditions are probably still somewhat accommodative, but it \u2019s a mixed bag . MICHELLE SMITH .  Richard . RICHARD ESCOBEDO.  Hi , Chair Powell.  I \u2019m Richard Escobedo with CBS News . One question for you.  T his month \u2019s statement notes that unemployment has stabilized at a low rate and that the labor market is solid .  You walked through some of what \u2019s driving this, but I wonder what risks you see that might challenge your assessment . CHAIR POWELL .  Well , the things we watch , we discussed earlier .  One, one is , is that there \u2019s a low hiring rate .  And so that if , if there were to be a spike in layoffs, if companies were to start to reduce headcount, you would see unemployment go up pretty quickly, because the hiring rate is quite low .  So that, that \u2019s one thing we look at . I think it \u2019s also \u2014it\u2019s worth pointing out that for lower -income households, they are \u2014 they\u2019 re under significant pressure .  And in the aggregate , the numbers are good, but we know\n\nJanuary 29, 2025   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nthat people at the lower end of the income spectrum are , are struggling with, with  costs .  And , really , it\u2019s, it\u2019s high inflation for the basics of life .  It\u2019s not so much the inflation now ; it\u2019s the price level , because inflation has raised prices.  I nflation is now closer \u2014much closer to target, but people are really feeling that.  But , you know, overall, this is a good labor market .  Here you\u2019re at 4.1 percent unemployment .  That\u2019s, that\u2019s just a really good level, and you\u2019 ve been solidly there now for six, seven months .  And job creation is pretty close to a level that will hold the unemployment rate there, given , given that , you know, there \u2019ll be much slower population growth. RICHARD ESCOBEDO.  One more question.  S ome of the uncertainty around immigration policy .  Is\u2014in your assessment, is that making i t harder for businesses and the Fed to plan going forward? CHAIR POWELL .  You know, we hear anecdotal reports , but I, I don \u2019t see\u2014there \u2019s nothing in the data yet on that .  But you do\u2014you hear \u2014you hear that kind of thing about construction, for example .  And, and, you know, businesses that are dependent on immigrant labor are , are saying that it \u2019s, it\u2019s suddenly gotten harder to, to  get people .  But I, again \u2014I know \u2014you don\u2019 t see that in the aggregate data yet, but yes, you, you hear it anecdotally. MICHELLE SMITH .  Nick . NICHOLAS JASINSKI .  Thank you, Chair Powell .  Nicholas Jasinski from Barron\u2019 s. The uncertainty is certainly a theme today, and I \u2019m wondering, are there any periods from your career , or as it relates to markets, the economy, what\u2019 s going on here in Washington and beyond, or from lessons from history , that may provide some guidance for a central banker operating in uncertain times like today ?\n\nJanuary 29, 2025   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nCHAIR POWELL .  I guess I \u2019d say this :  Uncertainty is , is with us all the time .  It\u2019s, it is human nature , apparently , to underestimate the \u2014how fat the tails are , in a way, that , you know, the, the possibility \u2014we think of things in a normal distribution, and in the economy it \u2019s not a normal distribution .  The tails are very fat, meaning things can happen way out of your expectations .  It\u2019s never not that way.  I wouldn\u2019 t\u2014you know, if you\u2014if you think about it \u2014 think about the first few months of the pandemic .  That was uncertainty .  Are we going to be able to reopen the economy?  If so, when ?  How much of it ?  How long will it take ?  You know, t hat was uncertainty .  What we have now is a good labor market .  We have the economy growing at , you know, 2 to 2\u00bd percent .  Inflation \u2019s come down to, to now the, you know \u2014the headli ne inflation number was 2.6 [percent], and that \u2019s what the public experiences.  We look at \u2014we look at core because it \u2019s a better indicator of future inflation .  So, yes, the price level went up a lot for inflation, and people are feeling that , and, and they\u2019 re not wrong.  But I \u2014so the kind of uncertainty we have is just a, a  usual level of uncertainty about the economy.  B ut then policies \u2014which are , you know, not for us to criticize or, or praise , really \u2014those are \u2014those are policies which people are, have been elected to implement .  They\u2019re implementing them with a view to , to making a better economy.  And so I , I don\u2019 t think \u2014I wouldn\u2019 t call this out as , as a\u2014 as one of those times.  I wouldn\u2019 t compare it to the Global F inancial C risis or anything like that, given that we have actually a very good economy right now . MICHELLE SMITH .  Evan . EVAN RYSER.  Evan R yser with Market News International.  Chair Powell, is a March cut still on the table ?  And then, additionally, are you looking to see better -than- expected data on inflation to cut, or are you looking for inflation data that roughly aligns with current forecasts ?\n\nJanuary 29, 2025   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nCHAIR POWELL .  So, as , as I mentioned, the economy\u2019 s strong, the labor market \u2019s solid, downside risks  to the labor market appear to have abated, and we think disinflation continues on a slow and sometimes bumpy path.  That tells me and the other members of the Committee \u2014the broad sense of the Committee , actually , is that we don\u2019 t need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance .  Your second question was ? EVAN RYSER.  Whether or not you need to see better -than-expected inflation data or just inflation data that roughly aligns with your current forecasts . CHAIR POWELL .  You know, it \u2019s one of those things we \u2019ll know it when we see it .  But more , more  the\u2014the expectation is that we will make continued progress , and, you know, that \u2019s what we want .  We, w e\u2019ll know it when we see it .  When we \u2014it, i t\u2019s going to have to be something that isn \u2019t just idiosyncratic .  You\u2019re going to want to see , you know, continued progress with housing services inflation;  you\u2019 re going to want to see inflation behaving in a way that builds confidence that we are really making progress .  That\u2019s what  it\u2019s going to be .  And , I mean, is, is that better than our expectations ?  If we expect to see that, it \u2019s just a question of when . MICHELLE SMITH .  Scott . SCOTT HORSLEY .  Hi, Chair Powell.  Scott Horsley from NPR .  In your five -year review , you said the , the 2 percent inflation target won \u2019t be on the table .  Can you talk a little about why?  Is that because you think that \u2019s the right target, or is it because you don\u2019 t want to move the goalpost midgame, or what\u2019s, what \u2019s behind that ? CHAIR POWELL .  I think to \u2014I think that goal has served us well over a long period of time.  It\u2019s also the sort of global standard.  I think that if, if a central bank wanted to look at changing that, you wouldn\u2019 t do it at a time when you\u2019 re not meeting it anyway.  I would not look\n\nJanuary 29, 2025   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nat changing it anyway, b ut I certainly wouldn \u2019t look at , at it at a time when you\u2019 re not \u2014when you\u2019re not meeting it .  I mean , there \u2019s just no interest at all in changing it, if, if  I\u2019m being at all unclear .  We \u2019re not \u2014we\u2019re not  going to change the inflation goal any time soon. SCOTT HORSLEY .  And, and five years ago, if I can paraphrase what you all decided , it was you\u2019 re going to not raise interest rates preemptively to , to head off inflation until you see sort of the whites of the eyes of inflation , because the  solid labor market was so beneficial.  Have the last few years changed your thinking about that ? CHAIR POWELL .  So what we really said was that we wouldn \u2019t\u2014we wouldn\u2019 t look at a\u2014at a strong labor market and raise rates unless we saw some evidence of inflation .  So the thought was that we \u2019d seen really low levels of inflation \u2014sorry, of unemployment \u2014with no sign of inflation .  So why would you preemptively want to\u2014 want to  put people out of work in the absence of , of any kind of \u2014any evidence that suggested that , that  this was not a sustainable level ?  It was a way of , of acknowledging how much humility we  have about , about  the starred variables, especially u*, the natural rate of unemployment .  So, that was  a\u2014that , that  was an insight .  We\u2019ll, we\u2019ll  discuss that again .  That\u2019ll be one of the many things that we discuss .  But I don\u2019t think that insight is wrong .  We didn\u2019 t\u2014you know, we, we \u2014what we said was that , you know, in\u2014at times when inflation persistently undershot 2 percent, we , we would likely allow inflation to run moderately above 2 percent for some time .  That \u2019s what we said .  That was\u2014 turned out not to be relevant to what actually happened.  There was nothing moderate about the overshoot .  It was \u2014it was an exogenous event .  It was the pandemic, and it happened , and, you know, our framework permitted us to act quite vigorously, and we did once we decided that that\u2019s what we should do.  Our  framework had really nothing to do with the decision to\u2014w e, we looked at the inflation as , as transitory , and\u2014right up to the point where the data turned against\n\nJanuary 29, 2025   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nthat, and when the data turned against that in late \u201921, we changed our , our view , and we raised rates a lot , and here we are at 4.1 percent unemployment and inflation way down.  But the framework was, was  more irrelevant than anything else .  The, the, that part of it\u2014 that part of it was irrelevant.  T he rest of the framework worked just fine as , as we used i t, as it supported what we did to bring inflation down. MICHELLE SMITH .  Go to Mark for the last question . MARK HAMRICK.  Hello , Chairman Powell .  Mark Hamrick with Bankrate.  As you know , in the annual report from the Financial Stability Oversight Council, among the risks outlined is cryptocurrency.  Could you talk about those risks now ?  And regarding individuals and households, perhaps distinct from the concern about the financial system, do you worry that speculation in this unregulated asset class could hurt their financial well -being, or do you think it has a place in a household\u2019 s portfolio ? CHAIR POWELL .  You know, so our , our role with Bitcoin , really , is to look at \u2014with crypto, really, is to look at the banks , and, and, you know, we , we think it \u2019s\u2014you know, banks are perfectly able to serve crypto customers, as long as they understand and can manage the risks and its safe, safe and soundness.   Many of our \u2014a good number of our banks that we regulate and supervise do that .  You know, t he threshold has been a little higher for banks engaging in crypto activities, and that \u2019s because they \u2019re so n ew, and, you know, we don\u2019 t want to make the mistake you\u2019re \u2014if you\u2014if you\u2019 re making a choice to conduct that activity inside a bank which is inside the federal safety net, with deposit insurance, then you want to be pretty sure that, that it \u2019s a safe and sound activity.  So, you know, we \u2019re, we\u2019re  not against innovation, and we certainly don\u2019 t want to , to take actions that would cause banks  to, you know, to terminate customers who are\n\nJanuary 29, 2025   Chair Powell \u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nperfectly legal just because of , of excess risk aversion maybe related to regulation and supervision, so. MARK HAMRICK.  And with respect to households and their inclusion in that  asset class? CHAIR POWELL .  I, you know, t hat\u2019s, that\u2019s  kind of a \u2014it\u2019s not really our , our bailiwick .  You want people to be knowledgeable about the financial engagements that they have , and that \u2019s why we have , you know, the securit ies law, laws that we have.  I t\u2019s why, you know, if you read a mutual fund prospectus or individual stock prospectus, you, you want households to have the chance to understand the risk that they \u2019re taking.  And, you know, I , I do think it would be helpful if there were a greater regulatory apparatus around crypto, and I think that, that\u2019s something Congress was working on quite a lot .  We\u2019ve actuall y spent a lot of time , you know, with members of Congress working together with them on, on  various things , and I , I think that would be a very constructive thing for , for Congress to do. Thank you."

My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on achieving our dual -mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of the American people .  The economy is strong overall and has made significant progress toward our goals over the past two years .  Labor market conditions are solid, and inflation has moved closer to our 2\u202fpercent longer -run goal, though it remains somewhat elevated. In support of our goals, today the Federal Open Market Committee decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged.  We also made the technical decision to slow the pace of decline in the size of our balance sheet .  I\u2019ll have more to say about these decisions after briefly reviewing economic developments. Economic activity continued to expand at a solid pace in the fourth quarter of last year, with GDP rising at 2.3 percent.   Recent indications , however, point to a moderation in consumer spending following the rapid growth seen over the second half of 2024.  Surveys of households and businesses point to heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook.  It remains to be seen how these developments might affect future spending and investment.  In our Summary of Economic Projections, the median participant pr ojects GDP to rise 1.7 percent this year, somewhat lower than projected in December, and to rise a bit below 2 percent over the next two years. In the labor market, conditions remain solid.   Payroll job gains averaged 200,000 per month over the past three months.  The unemployment rate, at 4.1 percent, remains low and has held in a narrow range for the past year.  The jobs -to-workers gap has held steady for several months.  Wages are growing faster than inflation and at a more sustainable pace than earlier in the pandemic recovery.  Overall, a wide set of indicators suggests that conditions in the labor\n\nMarch 19, 20 25   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nmarket are broadly in balance.   The labor market is not a source of significant inflationary pressures.   The median projection for the unemployment rate in the SEP is 4.4 percent at the end of this year and 4.3 percent over the next two years. Inflation has eased significantly over the past two years but remains somewhat elevated relative to our 2 percent longer -run goal.  Estimates based on the c onsumer price i ndex and other data indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.5 percent over the 12\u202fmonths ending in February and that, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent.  Some near-term measures of inflation expectations have recently moved up.   We see this in both market-  and survey- based measures, and surve y respondents, both consumers and businesses, are mentioning tariffs as a driving factor.   Beyond the next year or so, however, most measures of longer -term expectations remain consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal.   The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 2.7\u202fpercent this year and 2.2 percent next year, a little higher than projected in December.   In 2027, the median projection is at our 2\u202fpercent objective. Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.   At today \u2019s meeting, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4 \u00bc to 4 \u00bd percent.   Looking ahead, the new Administration is in the process of implementing significant policy changes in four distinct areas:  trade, immigration, fiscal policy, and regulation.  It is the net effect of these policy changes that will matter for the economy and f or the path of monetary policy.  While there have been recent developments in some of these areas, especially trade policy, uncertainty around the changes and their effects on the economic outlook is high.  As we parse the incoming information, we \u2019re focused on separating the signal from the noise as the outlook evolves.  As\n\nMarch 19, 20 25   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nwe say in our statement, in considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.  We do not need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance, and we are well positioned to wait for greater clarity. In our SEP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an appropriate path for the federal funds rate, based on what each participant judges to be the most likely scenario going forward\u2014an admittedly challenging exercise at this time  in light  of considerable uncertainty.   The median participant projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 3.9\u202fpercent at the end of this year and 3.4\u202fpercent at the end of next year, unchanged from December.  While these individual fo recasts are always subject to uncertainty, as I noted, uncertainty today is unusually elevated.  And, of course, these projections are not a Committee plan or a decision. Policy is not on a preset course.  As the economy evolves, we will adjust our policy stance in a manner that best promotes our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.   If the economy remains strong and inflation does not continue to move sustainably toward 2 percent, we can maintain policy restraint for longer.   If the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated, we can ease policy accordingly.   Our current policy stance is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate. At today\u2019 s meeting, we also decided to slow the pace of decline in our balance sheet. Since we began balance sheet runoff, our securities holdings have declined by more than $2 trillion.   While market indicators continue to suggest that the quantity of reserves remains abundant, we have seen some signs of increased tightness in money markets.   Beginning in\n\nMarch 19, 20 25   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nApril, the monthly cap on Treasury redemptions will be lowered from $25 billion to $5 billion. Consistent with the Committee \u2019s intention to hold primarily Treasury securities in the longer run, we are leaving the cap on agency securities unchanged.   This action has no implications for our intended stance of monetary policy and should not affect the size of our balance sheet over the medium term. The Committee also continued its discussions as part of our five -year review of our monetary policy framework.   At this meeting, we focused on labor market dynamics and our maximum -employment goal.  As we have indicated, our review will include outreach and public events involving a wide range of parties, including Fed Listens events around the country and a research conference in May.   Throughout this process, we will be open to new ideas and critical feedback, and we will take on board lessons of the last  five years in determining our findings . We intend to wrap up the review by late summer. The Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy :  maximum employment and stable prices.   We remain committed to supporting maximum employment, bringing inflation sustainably to our 2\u202fpercent goal, and keeping longer -term inflation expectations well anchored.  Our success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans.   We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country.   Everything we do is in service to our public mission.   We at the Fed will do ev erything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals. Thank you. I will look forward to your questions. MICHELLE SMITH .  Howard. HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Howard Schneider with Reuters.  Thanks for your time.  So two things on sort of the real side here, one inflation and then \u2014and then GDP.  How much of the\n\nMarch 19, 20 25   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nhigher inflation forecast for this year is due to tariffs , and since the policy path remains the same, are you effectively reading this as a one -time price -level shock? CHAIR POWELL.  Okay, so how much of it is , is tariffs? So let me say that it is going to be very difficult to have a precise assessment of how much of inflation is coming from tariffs and from , from  other \u2014and that \u2019s already the case.  You may have seen that goods inflation moved up pretty significantly in the first two months of the year.  Trying to track that back to actual tariff increases, given what was tariff ed and what was not \u2014very, very challenging.  So some of it\u2014 the, the  answer is clearly some of it \u2014a good part of it is , is coming from tariffs.  But we\u2019ll be\u2014we \u2019ll be working, and so will other forecasters , to try to find the best possible way to separate nontariff inflation from tariff inflation. In terms of the, the \u2014your , your  sort of looking -through question, too soon to say about that.  As , as I\u2019ve mentioned, it , it can be the case that it \u2019s appropriate sometimes to look through inflation if it \u2019s going to go away quickly without action by, by  us, if it\u2019s transitory.  And that can be the case in the case of , of tariff inflation.  I think that would depend on the , the tariff inflation moving through fairly quickly and would depend critically , as well , on inflation expectations being well  anchored\u2014l onger -term inflation expectations being well anchored. HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Well, I , I guess I \u2019m looking at the obvious here \u2014the fact that the policy path doesn\u2019 t change at all and inflation is unchanged in the outyears also.  D oesn\u2019t that imply you all have basically decided that there is no signal here and that it \u2019s just going to\u2014we \u2019re back to \u201c transitory \u201d again? CHAIR POWELL.  So I think\u2014 I think that\u2019 s kind of the base case, but , as I said,  it\u2019s\u2014 we really can \u2019t know that.  We\u2019 re going to have to see how things actually, actually work out. And the fact that there wasn \u2019t much change \u2014I think that \u2019s, that \u2019s partly because, you know, you\n\nMarch 19, 20 25   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nsee\u2014you see weaker growth but higher inflation .  They kind of offset.  And also, frankly, a little bit of inertia when it\u2014when it  comes to changing something in this highly uncertain environment .  You know, you\u2019 re\u2014you, you know, I think there is a level of inertia where you just say, \u201cMaybe I \u2019ll stay where I am. \u201d MICHELLE SMITH.  Colby. COLBY SMITH.  Thank you.  Colby Smith with the New York Times.   You just described inflation expectations as well  anchored, but has your confidence in that assessment changed at all, given the increase in certain measures and the high degree of uncertainty expressed by businesses, households, and forecasters? CHAIR POWELL.  So our  inflation expectations \u2014of course, we do monitor inflation expectations very, very carefully\u2014basically , every source we can find, and, you know \u2014short - term, long- term, households, businesses, forecasters, market -based.  And I think the picture , broadly, is this :  You do see increases widely in short -term inflation expectations .  And people who fill out surveys and answer, you know, questionnaires are pointing to tariffs about that.  If you look\u2014in the survey world, if you look a little f urther out, you, you really\u2014you really don \u2019t see much in the way of an increased longer -term inflation \u2014inflation expectations  are mostly well anchored , if you look at the [series maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of] New York , for example .  Then you have market based, and it \u2019s the same pattern .  You know, people and markets are pricing in and, and breakevens, some higher inflation over the next year must be related to tariffs.  We know from the surveys.  But if you look out five years or five -year, fiv e- year forward, you\u2019 ll see that breakevens have\u2014 are either flat or, actually , slightly down in the case of a longer -term one.\n\nMarch 19, 20 25   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nSo we look at that, and we will be watching all of it very, very carefully.  We do not take anything for granted.  T hat\u2019s at the very heart of our framework :  anchored inflation expectations .  But what \u2014that \u2019s what you see right now. COLBY SMITH.  And , and how much weight do you put on the deterioration in consumer confidence surveys?  You said recently that this is perhaps not the best indication of future spending.  B ut I\u2019m curious, you know, what you think is behind this deterioration and, and to what extent it could be a leading indicator for hard data . CHAIR POWELL.  So let \u2019s start with the hard data.  You know, we , we do see pretty solid hard data still.  So growth looks like it \u2019s maybe moderating a bit, consumer spending moderating a bit, but still at a solid pace.  Unemployment \u2019s 4.1 percent .  Job creation, most recently , has been at a healthy level.  Inflation has started to move up now, we think partly in response to tariffs, and there may be a delay in further progress over the course of this year.  So that\u2019s the hard data.  Overall, it \u2019s a solid pi cture.  The, the survey data, [in the case of] both household and businesses, show significant rise in uncertainty and significant concerns about downside risks.  So how do we think about that?  And that \u2019s\u2014that is the question . As I mentioned the other day, as you pointed out, the relationship between survey data and actual  economic activity hasn \u2019t been very tight .  There have been plenty of times where people are saying very down \u2014downbeat things about the economy and then going out and buying a new car.  But we don\u2019 t know that that will be the case here.  We will be watching very carefully for signs of weakness in the real data.  Of course we will.  But I, I\u2014you know, given where we are, we think our policy\u2019 s in a good place to r eact to, to what comes .  And we think that the right thing to do is , is to wait here for, you know, for greater clarity about , about what, what the economy\u2019 s doing.\n\nMarch 19, 20 25   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nMICHELLE SMITH.  Nick. NICK TIMIRAOS.  Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal.   Chair Powell, Chair Greenspan once defined price stability as, as  an environment in which inflation is so low and stable over time that it doesn \u2019t materially enter into the decisions of households and firms.  Can you say that today we have that price stability\u2014t hat households and businesses are igno ring price  growth , or do you see, by an advanced psychology, big changes in inventories and surveys that show consumers, at least in the short run, expect higher inflation? CHAIR POWELL.  So I , I do like that definition a lot .  In fact, I used it at the recent conference where I spoke.  So I think a world where , where  people can make their daily economic decisions , and businesses , and they\u2019 re not having to think about the possibility of significantly high inflation \u2014we know inflation will bounce around.  T hat\u2019s, that is price stability.  You know, I think we were getting closer and closer to that.  I wouldn\u2019 t say we were at that.  Inflation was running around 2 \u00bd percent for som e time.  I do think with the arrival of , of the tariff inflation, further progress may be delayed , if the SEP doesn \u2019t really show further downward progress on inflation this year.  And that, that \u2019s really due to the tariffs coming in. So, delayed, but if you look at our forecast, we do see ourselves getting back into the low 2s in \u201926 and then down to 2 [percent]  by \u201927\u2014of course , highly uncertain.  So I see progress having , having been made toward that, and then progress in the future .  I think that progress is probably delayed for the time being. NICK TIMIRAOS.  If that\u2019 s the case, why are there cuts in the SEP for 2025? CHAIR POWELL.  So, again, people wrote down two cuts the last time, and they look at\u2014they look at the \u2014you know, the \u2014and they wrote down, you know, meaningful decline in growth out from 2.1 to 1.7 in 2025, a tick up in the unemployment rate, so not much there , but\n\nMarch 19, 20 25   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\ncore inflation up by three -tenths .  And so those two kind of \u2014those kind of balance each other out.  So people \u2014not everybody, but , on balance , people wrote down similar numbers.  The changes aren \u2019t that big. The other \u2014the other  factor , though, as I mentioned, is just really high uncertainty.  What would you write down?  I mean, it \u2019s just \u2014it\u2019s really hard to know how this is going to work out . And, again, we think our policy \u2019s in a good place .  We think it \u2019s a good place where we can move in the direction that \u2014where we need to.  But in the meantime,  we, we \u2014it\u2019s, it\u2019s really appropriate to wait for further clarity , and, of course, you know, the cost s of doing that, given that the economy is still solid, are very  low. MICHELLE SMITH.  Edward. EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Edward Lawrence with F ox Business.  So with near 4 percent unemployment rate, that should be low enough to bring people in from the sidelines in terms of hiring.  But we \u2019re seeing the hiring rates have been stuck at 2023, 2024 levels.  So, what \u2019s going on there? CHAIR POWELL.  Yeah, so that \u2019s a feature of the\u2014has been for some time, a feature of this labor market.  You have pretty high participation, accounting for aging.  Y ou\u2019ve got wages that are consistent with 2 percent inflation, assuming that we \u2019re going to keep getting, you know, relatively high productivity.  We \u2019ve got unemployment, you know, pretty close to its natural level .  But job\u2014the hiring rate is quite low , but so is the layoff rate.  So  the, the \u2014you look at initial claims or layoffs .  So you\u2019 re not  seeing people losing their jobs, but you\u2019 re seeing that people who don\u2019 t have a job having to wait longer and longer.  And , you know, the question is , which way does that break?  If we were to see a meaningful increase in layoffs, then that would probably translate fairly quickly into unemployment , because people are \u2014you know, it\u2019s, it\u2019s\n\nMarch 19, 20 25   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nnot a \u2014it\u2019s not a big hiring market.  We\u2019ve been watching that, and it \u2019s just not in the data .  It hasn\u2019t happened.  What we\u2019 ve had is , is a low -firing, low -hiring situation, and it seems to be in balance now for , you know, for the last six, seven, eight months.  That \u2019s where we are.  T here\u2019s healthy levels of job creation , too.  So , overall , it\u2019s a labor market that \u2019s in balance, and, you know, we , we watch it very carefully. EDWARD LAWRENCE.  So then, have we seen the A dministration \u2014the new Administration \u2019s policies in the economic numbers yet?  And when do you anticipate that happening? CHAIR POWELL.  In labor? Or in , in other \u2014? EDWARD LAWRENCE.  In labor and inflation, just across the economy.  Have we started to see the new policies take effect in the numbers? CHAIR POWELL.  I, you know, only in a \u2014kind of an early way.  I mean , it\u2019s only been a few months, right?  You know, for example, the , the layoffs that are happening here are, you know, they\u2019 re certainly meaningful to the people involved, and they may  be meaningful to a particular neighborhood or region or area, but at the national level, they\u2019 re not \u2014they\u2019re not significant yet .  But we don\u2019 t know .  We don\u2019 t know  what \u2014where that \u2014how far that will go. We\u2019ll, we\u2019ll  find out much more. I mentioned that\u2014you, you saw it \u2014we\u2019ve had two, two very strong goods inflation readings in the last two months, which is very unexpected, a nd, I think , hard to trace it to specific tariffs .  But it must have \u2014it must have something to do with \u2014it\u2019 s either noise and it \u2019ll come back, and that \u2014that \u2019s very possible,  too.  B ut if it is persistent, then it must be to do with, you know, people buying ahead of tariffs, or raising prices ahead of tariffs, and things like that. That\u2014those kinds of things happen, and they\u2019 re very, very hard to capture because so much of it\n\nMarch 19, 20 25   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nis indirect.  A great example is  there \u2014washing machines were tariffed in the last , last  round of tariffs, and prices went up, but prices also went up on, on dryers, which were not tariffed.  So the manufacturers just, you know, they just kind of followed the crowd and, and raised it.  So things happen very indirectly, and so there \u2019ll be a lot of work done in the coming months to, to  try to trace all that through.  But , ultimately , though, it \u2019s too soon to be seeing significant effects in economic data. MICHELLE SMITH.  Craig. CRAIG TORRES.  Craig Torres from Bloomberg News.  Thanks , Chair Powell.  You said transitory price increases from tariffs are the base case\u2014 transitory is the base case.  Wasn \u2019t it the base case last time?  And didn\u2019 t the FOMC forecast lower inflation ahead last time?  And wasn \u2019t the lesson that it quickly got into services, haircuts, daycare, everything else?  And so I \u2019m just wondering why the nine aren\u2019 t taking that on board and are cutting twice this year. CHAIR POWELL.  When you say \u201c last time, \u201d are you talking about the last \u2014 CRAIG TORRES.  Pandemic, yes \u2014during the pandemic. CHAIR POWELL.  You could have been talking about the last time there were tariffs. CRAIG TORRES.  Okay. CHAIR POWELL.  In which case, the inflation was , was  transitory. CRAIG TORRES.  Yeah. CHAIR POWELL.  Yeah .  No\u2014of course , we\u2019re well  aware of that .  And, you know, it\u2019s, it\u2019s still the truth, if, if  there \u2019s an inflationary impulse that \u2019s going to go away on its own, it \u2019s not the right policy to, to  tighten policy, because by the time you have your e ffect, you\u2019 re\u2014you know, you\u2019re \u2014an  effect that by\u2014by design, you are lowering economic activity and employment .  And if that \u2019s not necessary, you don \u2019t want to do it.  In real time, as we know, it \u2019s\n\nMarch 19, 20 25   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nhard to make that judgment.  So\u2014and, and we \u2019re well aware, you know, of what happened, obviously, with, with  the pandemic inflation.  But , I mean, we have to look at this as a\u2014as a different situation .  There\u2019s, there are differences and similarities.  I mean , it\u2019s a different time . You know, we haven\u2019 t had real price stability fully reestablished yet, and we have to keep that in mind.  And , you know, we also have \u2014we hear that people are very reluctant to take on \u2014to, you know, to, to allow prices to go up.  A t the same time , we hear that businesses are intending to pass many of these prices through.  So it \u2019s hard to say how this is going to work  out. MICHELLE SMITH.  Steve. STEVE LIESMAN.  Steve, Steve Liesman, CNBC.  Thanks for taking my question, Mr. Chairman.  The Bank of Canada in its last policy statement said, \u201cMonetary policy cannot offset the impacts of a trade war.  What it can and must do is ensure that higher prices do not lead to ongoing inflation.\u201d   I wonder if that kind of reflects your own sense of prioritization , faced with higher prices  and weaker growth\u2014th at the idea is, you have to take care of inflation. CHAIR POWELL.  You know \u2014so we , we have two goals , right ?  We have maximum employment and price stability , and we have to balance those.  And , you know, there can be situations in which they are in tension, right?  And we have, actually have a provision in our \u2014in our consensus statement that says what we should do in that case.  That \u2019s a very challenging, you know, situation for , for any central bank, and certainly for us.  And so, what we say that we\u2019 ll do is, we\u2019ll, we\u2019ll look how far each of those two goals is \u2014each of those two measures is from its goal, and then we \u2019ll ask how long we think it might take to get back to the goal for each of them, and we \u2019ll make a judgment , because our, you know, our tools work in one direction.  We\u2019re either tightening or loosening.  So it \u2019s a very challenging situation.  Let me say, we don\u2019 t have that situation right now.  That \u2019s not what the \u2014that \u2019s not where the economy is at all.  It\u2019 s also\n\nMarch 19, 20 25   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nnot where the forecast is.  I don\u2019 t know any mainstream forecast that really shows significant problems like that, s o\u2014 STEVE LIESMAN.  Well, just to follow  up, yesterday the UCLA Anderson Forecast said there \u2019s\u2014a high probability of a recession.  Where , where  do you stand on whether or not t he slowdown you\u2019 re seeing creates a higher probability or concern that you may have on recession? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL.  You know, there \u2019s always an unconditional probability\u2014possibility of, of a recession.  It might be broadly in the range of one in four at any time , if you look back through, through the years .  It\u2014there  could be , within 12 months , a one in four chance of a recession.  So the question is, is whether that \u2014whether this current situation, those possibilities are elevated.  I will say this :  We don \u2019t\u2014we don\u2019t  make such a forecast.  If you look at outside forecasts, forecasters have, have generally raised \u2014a number of them have raised their possibility of a\u2014of a  recession somewhat, but still at relatively moderate levels \u2014you know, still in the region of , of the traditional, because they were extremely low .  If you go back two months, people were saying that the , the likelihood of a recession was extremely lo w.  So, has moved up, but it \u2019s not high. MICHELLE SMITH.  Chris. CHRIS TOPHER RUGABER.  Hi .  Thank you.  Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.  As you know, I guess , last night the \u2014President Trump fired two members of the Federal Trade Commission, an independent agency, and this could cause the kind of legal fight about the Administration \u2019s power to fire independent people.  If those firings stand, is that a threat to the Fed\u2019s independence?  Could he do the same thing to the Fed Board?\n\nMarch 19, 20 25   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nCHAIR POWELL.  So I think I , I did answer that question in this very room some time ago, and I , I [have] no desire to change that answer and have nothing new for you on that today. CHRIS TOPHER RUGABER.  Well , I just\u2014okay, well , maybe I \u2019ll have another mulligan.  [Laughter]  As you know, I , I want ed to go back to the consumer sentiment , particularly the inflation expectations in the University of Michigan s urvey.  In the summer of 2022, you cited the rise in the long -term inflation expectations in that index as the reason that you went big with a three -quarter -point hike.  So I know you\u2019ve \u2014I mean , you\u2019 ve talked about all the different measures now, but you seem to not be placing the same weight on that .  And so I\u2019m just wondering, are you dismissing that, what we s aw last week from the University of Michigan, or does that carry the same weight as it did in the past? CHAIR POWELL.  So I , I mentioned it back then, but in no way did I place a huge weight on it.  I think it, it \u2014that was an ex  post story, but it  wasn \u2019t the case.  That was a preliminary reading , and so is this.  And it \u2019s also \u2014this is \u2014that , that  Michigan, the one you\u2019 re referring to, the longer -term thing \u2014you know, we look at it , and we don\u2019 t dismiss data that we don\u2019t like .  We, we force ourselves to look at it.  But it is an outlier compared to market- based and compared to other survey- based assessments of longer -run inflation expectations , so we \u2019ve got to keep that in mind.  And I, I \u2014again, I , I would just say, we look at \u2014we look at  all of them. And that one \u2014that one \u2019s kind of an outlier, but , you know, nonetheless , we, we take notice of it. CHRIS TOPHER RUGABER.  Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH.  Michael. MICHAEL MCKEE.  Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television.  There is a worry on Wall Street that when you say you want to study the net effect of the fiscal policies , we may see on the economy that you would end up waiting too long and be \u201c behind the curve \u201d in\n\nMarch 19, 20 25   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nresponding to any downturn.  How can you reassure people that you can spot a problem early enough, unless you decide to be preemptive? CHAIR POWELL.  Yeah, look, we\u2019re, we \u2019re aware of the \u2014we\u2019 re well  aware of how things are going to evolve and the time frames and all that, and , you know, we will \u2014we will  use our tools to foster achievement of our goals to the \u2014to the  best we can.  And, of course , we\u2019re going to try to be timely with that.  For right now, the hard data are pretty solid .  We, we are obviously aware of the soft sentiment data and high uncertainty, and we \u2019re watching that carefully.  And we think it \u2019s a, a  good time for us to wait for further clarity before we consider adjusting our , our policy stance. MICHAEL MCKEE.  Do you think it \u2019s going to be hard to get clarity in a \u201c government by twe et\u201d?  I mean , do you have a , a feeling that at some point you actually will have a forecast you can trust? CHAIR POWELL.  Yes, I think we will.  I just \u2014it\u2019 s hard to say when that will be.  You know, we \u2019re\u2014these decisions are going to be made, and they \u2019re going to be implemented , and then we \u2019ll know.  At that point , we\u2019ll know what the decisions are , and we \u2019ll have to make assessments then about their, their implications for the economy.  Those things will happen.  A lot of them will happen over the course of, you know, in coming months, certainly over the course of this year, and we \u2019ll be adapting as we go. MICHELLE SMITH.  Rachel. RACHEL SIEGEL.  Hi , Chair Powell.  Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.  Thank you for taking our questions.  At the beginning, you were talking about separating the signal from the noise, and tariff inflation from nontariff inflation .  Can you \u201c walk us through\u201d  what that\n\nMarch 19, 20 25   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nlooked like over the last couple of months \u2014if there were specifics, from the January meeting to now, that helped you make those distinctions ? CHAIR POWELL.  So when we say \u201c separating the signal from the noise, \u201d that\u2019s just a way of saying that things are highly uncertain and that, you know, you\u2019 re reading about developments \u2014the news is full of developments of  tariffs being put on and taken off and things like that.  That \u2019s\u2014some of that is noise in the sense that it \u2019s, it\u2019s not really telling you anything. You\u2019re trying to extract a signal from that, and the signal is what\u2019 s going to be the effect on economic activity, on inflation, on employment, and all those things.  So, so that \u2019s really when we say \u201c signal and noise. \u201d Sorry, the second thing was \u2014? RACHEL SIEGEL.  Or , similarly for tariff inflation, nontariff inflation, ways that you \u2019re making the distinction . CHAIR POWELL.  That \u2019s, that\u2019s  sort of a , a special case of that \u2014of, you know, with the idea being \u2014and I  think \u2014do think that the first two months of this year are a great example. You\u2019ve got high readings for goods inflation after a string of readings that average d close to zero, and you have to ask\u2014it\u2019 s coming during tariffs, but , you know, you\u2014it\u2019 s very hard to , actually , scientifically go back and match up those increases and say , \u201cYes, I can prove that that\u2019s from tariffs. \u201d  But it kind of has to be , to some extent.  Plus, noise .  There can be idiosyncratic readings in various categories, which will shortly reverse, and that , that  happens , too, a nd that could be a big piece of it.  You know, I think we \u2019ll know .  In a couple of months , we\u2019ll know whether those were \u2014you know, where that really was from.  But it\u2019 s a\u2014 that\u2019s another case where I think it \u2019s going to be very, very challenging to unpack the inflation that we see over the course of this year and be able to say with confidence how much of that came from\n\nMarch 19, 20 25   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\ninflation and how much of it \u2014sorry, from tariffs \u2014and how much of it didn\u2019 t.  But that\u2019 s what we\u2019ll be doing.  W e\u2019ll be doing that , and so will everybody else , and we \u2019ll all be trying very hard to, to make that assessment .  And, you know, I, I \u2019m sure we will make a lot of progress on that. And we already have.  But it, it\u2019s going to be a challenge. RACHEL SIEGEL.  Do you have a sense yet as to what, in your mind, what makes something cross from noise to a signal \u2014what that threshold would look like? CHAIR POWELL.  You know, it would depend on what we \u2019re talking about.  I mean , obviously, you \u2019re looking for direct evidence that , that  particular pieces of , of inflation are,  are\u2014 or are clearly not \u2014caused by tariffs.  For example, something that was, you know, in the service sector that was far away from anything that \u2019s tariffed.  You , you might think, okay, well that is \u2014 like, frankly , housing services inflation\u2014which , which, by the way, has been behaving well. You know \u2014which , for, for some time , was kind  of our problem .  Now it \u2019s been \u2014it\u2019 s slow, but it\u2019s definitely, you know, moving down in a \u2014in a  very good way.  It\u2019s more now with goods and, to some extent , with , with  nonhousing services inflation. MICHELLE SMITH.  Kelly. KELLY O\u2019GRADY.  Thanks for taking our questions, Chair Powell.  Kelly O \u2019Grady, CBS News.  So consumer sentiment has dipped dramatically , but you say the economy and the hard data is still solid.  What is your message to consumers that clearly disagree and don \u2019t feel that strength?  Because the hard data they \u2019re looking at is their grocery bill. CHAIR POWELL.  Okay, so a couple things .  The grocery bill is about , about  past inflation, really.  There was inflation in \u2019 21, \u201922, and \u2019 23, and prices went up.  The current level \u2014it\u2019s not the change in prices.  It\u2019s, they\u2019 re unhappy\u2014and, and they \u2019re not wrong to be unhappy\u2014that prices went up quite a bit , and they\u2019 re paying a lot for those things.  So that \u2019s\u2014I\n\nMarch 19, 20 25   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nthink that is the fundamental fact and has been for a long time \u2014a couple years\u2014why people are unhappy with the \u2014with the  economy.  It\u2019 s not that the economy\u2019 s not growing.  I t\u2019s not that inflation \u2019s really high .  It\u2019s not that unemployment is high.  It \u2019s none of those things.  We have, you know, 4.1 percent unemployment .  We\u2019ve got 2 percent growth, and,  you know, it \u2019s, it\u2019s a pretty good economy.  But people are unhappy because of the price level.  And , and I do\u2014we completely understand and accept that. KELLY O\u2019GRADY.  And just to follow  up:  W hy are you still projecting two rate cuts this year if your own projections show inflation higher for longer?  Does that mean you see a slowdown in economic growth as a real threat? CHAIR POWELL.  So I , I think if you\u2014yeah, I mean, remember , we came into this with\u2014at the December meeting, and the median was two cuts, the median was.  And so you come in , and you see, broadly speaking, weaker growth but higher inflation.  And they kind of balance each other out, so you think \u2014and, and unemployment is really, really only , only a one - tenth  change.  So it \u2019s\u2014there \u2019s just not a big change in the forecast.  There really isn \u2019t.  Modest, you know, meaningfully higher  growth and meaningfully higher inflation, which call for different responses , right?  So they cancel each other out , and people just said, \u201cO kay, I \u2019m going to stay here. \u201d But the second factor is, it \u2019s so highly uncertain.  Is just \u2014you know, we \u2019re sitting here thinking\u2014 and we , we obviously are in, in touch with businesses and households all over the country.  We have an extraordinary network of contacts that come in through the R eserve B anks and put it in the Beige Book\u2014and also through contacts at the Board.  And we get all that, and we, we do understand that sentiment has fallen off pretty sharply, but economic activity has not yet.  And so we \u2019re watching carefully .  So I would tell people that the economy seems to be \u2014\n\nMarch 19, 20 25   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nseems to be healthy.  We understand that , that  sentiment is , is quite negative at this time, and that probably has to do with, you know, turmoil at the beginning of an A dministration.  It\u2019s making, you know, big changes in, in areas of policy , and that \u2019s probably part of it.  I do think the underlying unhappiness people have about the economy, though, is more \u2014is more about the price level. MICHELLE SMITH.  Victoria. VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi.  Victoria Guida with Politico.  I wanted to ask , first of all, if you could clarify.  You were talking about how tariffs were a good part of the uptick in the inflation forecasts, and I was just wondering what that specifically refers to .  Is that the tariffs that have already been put in place?  Is that anticipating some of the tariffs that might be coming on April 2?  And then also, if you wouldn\u2019 t mind talking a little more about the balance sheet decision and what drove that.  Did t hat have anything to do with expectations of how the debt ceiling \u2014raising the debt ceiling might affect the reserve supply? CHAIR POWELL.  Yeah, so, in the SEP , you\u2019 ll see that there \u2019s not further progress on core inflation this year.  We\u2019re kind of side flatlining, going sideways.  We don\u2019 t ask people to say\u2014to write down how much of this is from tariffs and how much of it is not.  But some of it is from tariffs.  We know that tariffs are coming, and we know that they\u2019 re probably already\u2014all , all forecasters have tariff inflation affecting core PCE inflation  [and] core CPI inflation this year, without exception.  I\u2019m not aware of an exception.  So it \u2019s in there .  I can \u2019t tell you how much of that it is. In terms of the balance sheet \u2014so , yeah, we \u2014I think \u2014I guess the way I \u2019d say it is, you know, it was the flows in and out of the , the TGA that got us thinking about it, but as we, you know, as we thought about it, we really came to the view that this was a good time to, to make\n\nMarch 19, 20 25   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nthe move that we made.  And , broadly, Committee came around \u2014came around to the view that we, we would do the same thing we \u2019d already done, which is , once we \u2014I guess in June, we \u2014 was it June?  Whenever it was, we, we  lowered the pace of QT , and we \u2019re just going to do that again.  We \u2019re going to cut it roughly in half.  And the sense of that is , if you\u2019 re cutting the pa ce of QT roughly in half, then the runway is probably doubled, okay?  So it \u2019s going\u2014it \u2019s going to be slower for longer.  And people really like d that.  People thought, \u201cT hat\u2019s, that\u2019s  a good idea.\u201d You know, it \u2019s like a plane.  Y ou can think of it like a plane coming in for a landing.  As we get closer and  we\u2014by the way, we still think that  reserves are abundant, although you begin to see some of the \u2014some of the things we look at begin to react a little bit , but we still think that they\u2019 re abundant.  And , of course , now, the TGA is emptying out, so reserves are , are higher now, so you can\u2019 t really see the underlying signal.  So we came around to the view , and , and it had a lot of appeal, and so we did it.  It really \u2014it has no implications at all for monetary policy . It has no implications at all for the ultimate size of the balance sheet.  I t isn\u2019t sending a signal in any hidden way that you can try to tease out.  It\u2019s just not there.  We \u2019re, we\u2019re  basically \u2014it\u2019s very consistent with our plans and our practices that we \u2019ve published and that we \u2019ve followed since we began this \u2014what is a very successful, you know, rundown of  the balance sheet.  Again, [this is] the second time that we\u2019 ve slowed the pace.  A nd we \u2019ve said that we would stop when we were somewhat above the level [of reserves] we judge as ample.  And , clearly , we\u2019re not at that level yet, but we \u2019re going to be approaching it more slowly.  It\u2019 s a commonsense kind of a \u2014 kind of a  thing, and it had\u2014it had  pretty broad appeal, I will say. MICHELLE SMITH.   Claire. CLAIRE JONES.  Claire Jones, Financial Times.   You said in January, Chair Powell, that inflation expectations remained well anchored.  Would you still say they remain well\n\nMarch 19, 20 25   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nanchored today?   And just to reiterate the question others have asked , if they\u2019re not so well anchored, why hasn\u2019 t there been a more radical shift to the policy path today?  Thank you. CHAIR POWELL.   So when we \u2014when we  talk about inflation expectations being well anchored, we \u2019re talking about longer -run inflation expectations.  And they really haven\u2019 t moved much, I mean, if at all.  There, t here\u2019 s one reading that everyone \u2019s focusing on that \u2019s higher, but the other survey readings and the market -based readings all show relatively, you know, well - anchored inflation expectations.  You would expect that expectations of inflation over the course of a year would move around, because conditions change, and in this case , we have tariffs coming in.  We don\u2019 t know how bi g, what \u2019s\u2014there \u2019s so many things we don\u2019 t know, but we kind of know there are going to be tariffs , and they tend to bring growth down.  T hey tend to bring inflation up at the \u2014in the firs t instance.  So, so I would say, you, you know, I \u2019m not dismissing what we \u2019re seeing in short -term inflation expectations.  We, as I mentioned, follow that very carefully.  But when we say expectations are well  anchored, we \u2019re really looking at, you know, longer term, five year and out, and there \u2019s really no story to tell five years and out, either in market based or , or in surveys.  But we keep \u2014we \u2019ll watch it.  I mean , we\u2019re not, you know, we\u2019re, we \u2019re not going to miss any evidence that longer -term or med ium-term inflation expectations are , are moving. MICHELLE SMITH.  Neil. NEIL IRWIN.  Hi , Chair Powell.  Neil Irwin with Axios.  Treasury Secretary Bessent has observed that a large share of job growth over the last couple of years has been in what he calls government or government -adjacent sectors\u2014health  care, education.  Do you agree that there \u2019s some weakness in underlying private job growth, and do you see the composition of job growth as something that has policy implications?\n\nMarch 19, 20 25   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nCHAIR POWELL.  So  that,  that has been the case.  We talked about that over the course of the last year.  There were\u2014there were some good number of months and times when a lot of the job creation was , was  concentrated in, you know, educational institutions, health care, state governments, things like that.  There were also times when private -sector job growth has been moving, moving in a healthy frame \u2014and they\u2019 re all \u2014they\u2019re all  jobs, but \u2014and remember, we\u2019re, you know, we \u2019re at very low unemployment for, you know, for , for quite a time now.  So I, I think it \u2019s a good labor market, but it \u2019s\u2014look, it \u2019s something that we monitor carefully.  From our standpoint, employment is employment.  But  I, you know \u2014the , the elected government is entitled to have \u2014you know, we , we don\u2019 t have policies that address different kinds of employment.  But , but the elected government has a\u2014has a different role , and they can\u2014they, they can have those. NEIL IRWIN.  True.  Quick QT question:   Does the Committee envision at some point tapering the MBS runoff , runoff  as well? CHAIR POWELL.  I think tapering it\u2014I , I don\u2019 t know .  There\u2019s no plan to do that.  You know, at a certain point , we\u2019ll stop runoff.  A nd we may or may not stop MBS runoff , though, because, you know, we can\u2014we can \u2014we , we want to stop runoff in net at some point.  We haven\u2019 t made any decisions about that, but , you know, we , we want the \u2014we want the  MBS to roll off our balance sheet.  We really, strongly desire that , so\u2014but we haven\u2019 t made any decisions about that , you know .  We, we will\u2014we \u2014I think we \u2019d, we \u2019d look carefully at letting that keep going, but hold the overall size of the balance sheet in, you know, constant , at some point \u2014a point that we \u2019re not at yet. MICHELLE SMITH.  Simon.\n\nMarch 19, 20 25   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nSIMON RABINOVITCH.  Simon Rabinovitch with the Economist.  Thank you, Chair Powell.  Several times today , you\u2019ve  said that you feel you \u2019re well  positioned to wait for greater clarity.  At the same time, you could point to quite a few growth risks at the moment.  We\u2019 ve seen a stock market that \u2019s gone quite wobbly, rapidly cooling housing sales, plunging confidence surveys.  Today, not only did the SEP mark down the growth outlook, 17 of 19 see risks to the downside.  So my question is, how confident are you that you \u2019re well  positioned?  Or is that one more thing that you\u2019 re uncertain about? CHAIR POWELL.   I\u2019m confident that we \u2019re well  positioned in the sense that we \u2019re, we\u2019re  well  positioned to move in the direction we \u2019ll need to move.  I , I mean , I, I don\u2019 t know anyone who has a lot of confidence in their forecast.  I mean , the point is, we are \u2014we are at, you know, we \u2019re at a place where we can cut or we\u2014 or we  can hold what is a clearly a restrictive stance of policy.  And that \u2019s what I mean.  I, I mean , I think we \u2019re\u2014that \u2019s well  positioned. Forecasting right now, it \u2019s\u2014you know, forecasting is always very, very hard, and in the current situation, I just think it \u2019s\u2014uncertainty is , you know, remarkably high. SIMON RABINOVITCH.  And , sorry, standing here today, would you be surprised to, to pivot back towards rate cuts in May? CHAIR POWELL.  I , like, I, I  think we \u2019re not going to be in any hurry to move .  And, as I mentioned, I think we \u2019re, we\u2019re  well  positioned to wait for further clarity , and not in any hurry. MICHELLE SMITH.  Matt Egan. MATT EGAN.  Matt Egan with  CNN.  Thank you, Chair Powell.  The Fed \u2019s statement released today removed the line that previously said \u201c the Committee judges that the risk s to achieving its employment and inflation goals are roughly in balance.\u201d   Can you explain the\n\nMarch 19, 20 25   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\ndecision to remove that line?  Does it mean that you \u2019re now more concerned about inflation or about employment? CHAIR POWELL.  A ctually , it does not mean either of those things.  You know, sometimes with language they\u2014it , it lives its , its useful life , and then we take it off , and we \u2014 and, and that was the case there .  There \u2019s really not meant to be any signal here.  Over the past year, you know, conveying this sense of the balance of risks was important that they be in balance or close to being in balance.  That was useful as we approach liftoff, if you remember . But we \u2019re past that.  Or, I\u2019m sorry, no \u2014beginning, beginning to cut.  So we just \u2014so we just took it out.  I, I actually would say that the more important thing now a bout risks \u2014and this is in , in pages like 10, 11, 12 of the SEP \u2014if you look, participants widely raised their estimate of, of the risks to our \u2014of uncertainty, but also of the risks to growth in our employment and inflation mandates.  That\u2019s, that\u2019s  a more salient point now than whether they \u2019re\u2014whether they\u2019 re in balance. MATT EGAN.  Just on the , the stock market, the stock market has obviously declined significantly since the Fed last met.  Are you concerned at all about some of the market volatility having a real economic impact in terms of hurting business spending or consumer spending, especially among higher -income households? CHAIR POWELL.  So financial conditions matter to us because , you know, financial conditions are the main channel to the real economy through which our policy has its e ffect.  So , so they\u2019 re important.  But what matters from, from  a Fed standpoint for the macroeconomy is material changes to overall financial conditions that are persistent, that last for a while \u2014long enough to actually affect economic activity.  So that \u2019s what we \u2019re looking for.  I, I \u2019m not going to opine on the appropriate level of any market \u2014equity, debt, commodities, or anything like that.\n\nMarch 19, 20 25   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nAnd I would just point you to the \u2014to the bigger picture again.  Y ou know, the , the real economy, the , the hard data are still in , in reasonably good shape.  It\u2019 s the soft data \u2014it\u2019 s the surveys that are showing, you know, significant concerns, downside risks, and those kind of things.  We don\u2019 t dismiss that.  We\u2019re watching it carefully, but , you know, we , we don\u2019 t want to get ahead of that.  You know, we , we want to focus on the hard data .  This \u2014if it\u2019s\u2014if that\u2019 s going to affect the hard data, we should know it very quickly, and, and, of course , we\u2019ll, we\u2019ll understand that.  But you don\u2019 t see that yet. MICHELLE SMITH.  Jennifer. JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.  Thank you, Chair Powell.  Jennifer Schonberger with Yahoo Finance.  As you look to navigat e higher inflation and lower growth, the Fed has talked about heeding the lessons from the 1970s.  Is the Fed willing to have a recession if it means breaking the back of inflation? CHAIR POWELL.  Well, fortunately, we \u2019re in a situation where we have seen inflation move down from, you know, higher levels to pretty close to 2 percent, while the unemployment rate has remained very consistent with full employment, 4.1 percent.  So we now have inflation coming in from an exogenous source, but the underlying inflationary picture before that was, you know, basically 2\u00bd percent inflation , I would say , and 2 percent growth, and 4 percent unemployment.  So , so that \u2019s what \u2014that \u2019s what we did .  That\u2019s what,  together, the economy accomplished.  So I don\u2019 t see any reason to think that we \u2019re looking at , at a replay of the \u2019 70s or anything like that.  You know, inflation\u2014underlying inflation is, is, you know, still running in the 2s, with probably a little bit of a pickup associated with tariffs.  So  I, I don\u2019 t think we \u2019re facing \u2014I, I wouldn\u2019 t say we \u2019re in, in a situation that \u2019s remotely comparable to that.\n\nMarch 19, 20 25   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER.  And last month , the idea of a DOGE dividend was proposed, which would send $5,000 checks to every taxpayer from DOGE savings.  President Trump and Elon Musk have supported this.  There \u2019s reports there could be a bill introduced on Capitol Hill.  What impact might that have on household savings and spending in terms of your growth and, and outlook for inflation? CHAIR POWELL.  You know, I \u2014it\u2019 s not \u2014it\u2019s not  appropriate for me to speculate on political ideas or, or  fiscal policy , for that matter.  So I \u2019m going to\u2014I \u2019m going to pass on that one.  Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH.  Daniel. DANIEL AVIS.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Daniel Avis from Agence France -Presse.  You mentioned that tariffs are already having at least some impact on inflation.  I \u2019m just wondering how you and your colleagues on the FOMC have been thinking about the possibility of retaliatory tariffs from other countries, especially with April 2 coming up.  Was it something you considered during this meeting?  Thanks. CHAIR POWELL.  So, since the very beginning, we \u2019ve had kind of a placeholder \u2014the staff has a placeholder of \u2014range of \u2014really a range of possible outcomes from tariffs, and from trade policy generally.  And they generally assume full retaliation in those.  And so that \u2019s, that\u2019s kind of baked into the numbers.  What happens \u2014it will be complicated , and there will be some retaliation and some not and, and all that, but , ultimately , they\u2019re trying to, with the placeholder, give us a broad sense of what this might look like.  This \u2014when we know \u2014when we actually know the specifics, we \u2019ll be able to , to have still uncertain but , you know, better -informed forecasts.  So , so, yes, that \u2019s in there. MICHELLE SMITH.  Last question goes to Jean.\n\nMarch 19, 20 25   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nJEAN YUNG.  Hi , Chair Powell.  Jean Yung with MNI Market News.  Had a couple questions on the balance sheet change that you made.  So the minutes had initially described your discussion on slowing QT as temporary, until the debt ceiling is resolved, but  it\u2014from what you said earlier, doesn \u2019t sound like there \u2019s a desire to kind of regain the pace of QT that we have at the moment after the , the debt ceiling is resolved.  Is that the case? CHAIR POWELL.  Yeah, so we , we looked at pausing, and we looked at , at slowing, and, really , people came together very strongly behind slowing, not pausing, for a variety of reasons.  And so people really came to be, you know, pretty strongly in favor of , of this move.  It slows down the path and probably lengthens it \u2014you know, doubles it , effectively , by slowing it by half.  That \u2019s, that\u2019s \u2014people thought that \u2019s, that\u2019s  a good place to be.  It\u2019ll, it\u2019ll, you know, help us assure that this path is, is  a smooth one as we get closer and closer to that.  So that \u2019s how that came about. JEAN YUNG.  Well, I guess my question is more, was that meant to be a temporary measure during the debt ceiling episode, or \u2014? CHAIR POWELL.  You know, it was \u2014it was actually \u2014it was  the, the TGA flows \u2014 Treasury General Account flows that got us thinking about this .  But the more we thought about it, we came around to this.  And , and, you know, it , it is\u2014yes , it was provoked.  T he original discussion was provoked by that.  But I think what we came up with , though, was broader  than that and different than it.  I t does address that issue, but it really is also \u2014it fits in really nicely with our principles and our plans, and the things w e\u2019ve done before, and the things we \u2019ve said we would do.  So that \u2019s why I \u2014you know, pretty , pretty strong support.  I \u2019d just say it \u2019s, it\u2019s nothing to do with monetary policy, nothing to do with the size of the balance sheet .  It\u2019s just kind of a commonsense adjustment as you get closer and closer.  Let \u2019s slow down a little bit\n\nMarch 19, 20 25   Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference   FINAL\n\nagain .  And, that way , we\u2019ll be more and more confident that we \u2019re getting where we need to get. You can take your time getting there .  You know, we \u2019re shrinking the balance sheet every month, and we think that \u2019s\u2014we think it was a good play and, as I mentioned, well  supported. Thanks very much."
