Governor Michelle W. Bowman

At the Forum Club of the Palm Beaches, West Palm Beach, Florida

Good afternoon. 1 It is a pleasure to join you for today's meeting of the Forum Club of the Palm Beaches. It is truly humbling for me to be invited to speak to your membership, in the company of the many influential leaders, authors, and other public figures this organization has hosted since its founding in 1976.
